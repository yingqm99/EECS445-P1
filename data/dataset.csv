Our waitress, Colleen, was very friendly and attentive.  Our food and drinks were brought to us in a timely manner.  We ordered the fried eggplant straws with basil aioli for our appetizer, and we also had bread with dipping oil.  Both were delicious and very filling! I ordered the chocolate and coffee duck breast and my mom ordered the Alaskan cod for our entrees, both dishes were exceptional!!  We will definitely be returning!",1,1,1

It's right off bridge avenue, quiet and quaint, good coffee, relaxing atmosphere, it's close to the library so I grab a cup and go! Highly recommended. Bright & spacious, plenty of seating. The earl tea is amazing, their dirty chai is okay, a bit too strong for my taste. Overall I was pleased!",0,0,1

Attention: Director of Seven Hills Surgery Center Henderson
It gives me great pleasure to inform you of the professionalism, courtesy, clean and well-established medical facility in which I was an inpatient and outpatient for a medical procedure. I want to acknowledge and sincerely congratulate the men and women that worked on August 20th, 2019 from 11:00 A.M. until 2 P.M. for the 7 to 3 shift.  I was welcomed at the center immediately upon arrival by a lovely medical records nurse named Jasmine who immediately acknowledge my veteran status with a warm ""thank you for your service"" smile and pleasant attitude.  Jasmine's conversation was family and friend orientated in which is very important to any individual that walks through the facility doors that may be going through the repercussions of family and personal mental issues. My personal nurse, my anesthesiologist, and my doctor were just lovely and comforting, and the most important perspective was that every detail was explained from how the procedure was going to take place and what to expect after the procedure.  During my stay at the medical facility, I observed the interactions of all the staff members, their conversations one with another and their engagements with other patients and housekeeping staff and I was truly, truly impressed beyond measure by how the nurse's and clinical nurse assistants performed promptly and non-hesitatingly.  Nurse's were going on there lunch breaks and took the time out to assist their co-worker for a minor detail while they were on break.  I had forgotten to turn the volume down on my cell phone, and it was ringing in my property bag under my bed and a nurse who was getting ready to go on break, took a 15 second break just to get my phone for me, and told me that I could keep it until my procedure started.  During this moment I heard nothing but respect from other patients to the staff members as well.  I heard words from staff members supporting and encouraging one another such as "" you go and take your break, I will handle this"" I saw senior citizen nurses training young nurse assistants in which I assumed must of have recently been hired at the facility.  Moreover, the presence, the atmosphere in the work environment was just heavenly and would make any patient feel safe, secure and to know that their care was in good hands. I want to say thank you also for the human resources department and supervisors who hired these individuals, for from my intake to the recovery room everything was superiorly professional and most of all family-oriented, thank you so much for demonstrating God's love for your care for all people.
Truly and sincerely,

0,I came in here on my birthday to get the 18th birthday special (whoop whoop) and they were very quick to let me know that it would just be a couple minutes before they were able to help out which is totally cool. I filled out me paperwork and sat for maybe 5 or so minutes before Jacob came out to get me for my septum piercing. He was very thorough in his explanation of what he was doing before he did any of it. He talked through the whole thing and I barely felt a thing at all so obviously he knew what he was doing! He talked through the after care instructions with me twice (once before the piercing and once after) and sent me home with more sea salt than I will ever need and more instructions so I won't forget. It was a great experience and I will definitely come back for more,0,0,1
0,"I ate the most amazing sandwich here for lunch and I owe it all to yelpers. The Bahn Mi Sandwich. The pulled pork was very juicy and tender and there was a generous portion. The sour daikon and carrot pickles along with the cilantro and aioli paired perfectly. It was so filling I was full after half but decided to finish it since the bread was getting soggy, not good leftover material. I was almost tempted to order one of the daily specials written on a chalkboard beside the counter and need to come back for those.

If you dine inside there are tables and a charging station inside. There are tables outside also. They will give you a number and bring the food out to you. I was in a hurry, so I ordered my food to go. Your name will be called when it is ready and they box and bag your food super conveniently. While I was waiting, I wandered around the store looking at the gourmet chocolates and candy they had on display. There are also salads, small sides, and dessert options boxed up. And a coffee bar. Also, a good selection of wine and craft beer. This place has everything.

Parking can be tricky during peak times - there are a few spots along the street right outside but not too many.",0,0,1

My husband and myself had the gyro platter - very good and the place was hopping - not sure if it was because it was a Friday or as we have now learned it's that good.  And there are truly Greek people working there - now that is authentic!  Nothing fancy - you're eating on paper plates with plastic ware - easy clean up!

Definitely going back and trying something different....",0,1,1

The lady was very nice and open to finding her mistakes and fixing them before I could say anything, but there were a few things I didn't like about these nails too much, but I'm picky, so I'm overall satisfied. A little sloppy, with polish in my cuticles and a few spots where she missed and there are bubbles... but like I said, I'm happy with them. I decided to also get a pedicure, but I wanted just regular polish on my toes (while I got gel on my hands) and they were very nice and accurate about choosing a color most similar to it. For a while, I was kind of just standing there, hoping for them to realize that I was getting a pedicure as well. But it was great! For the price, I'm very happy with what I have now, and if it wasn't for the fact that I'm on vacation, I'd come back for sure!",0,0,1

1,"Whether you call it Shannxi Biang Biang or House of Egg Roll, the idea of new regional Chinese food is exciting. China is a huge country and as a Millennial I'm all about trying new places and things. I've read Fuchsia Dunlop. Of course, none of that goes very far towards helping me understand what I've eaten from a cultural perspective: the Shaanxi sandwich tasted great and it's hard to go wrong with the Shananxi-style handmade noodles. I liked how the dish veered more towards vinegar. It's something I wish I knew more about, but in the meantime I like the idea of this very specific Chinese restaurant offering something that's difficult to find anywhere else.",0,1,1

1,"I recently stayed in the Paris hotel for a bachelorette party. When looking for a brunch place, we found Mon Ami Gabi near the base of the Eiffel Tower and decided to give it a try. We had a party of ten, and we arrived around 11:15 a.m. on a Saturday morning. The servers were very accommodating and got us a table on the patio right away. The patio was great, with an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains and the strip. It was perfect for people watching. We started with a round of mimosas, which arrived quickly and were very good. They gave us both a brunch and lunch menu.. I ordered a ham & cheese crepe off the lunch menu. It was amazing!! Super hearty and full of yummy flavors. I tried my friend's French toast, and it was amazing as well. The server was attentive, and didn't even bat an eye when we asked if she could split our check 10 ways. Highly recommend for brunch!",0,0,1
4,"I received a criminal speeding ticket just outside of Nogales when I was going down there for business. I was cited for 69 mph in a 45 mph zone and in AZ that is a criminal charge. I did not realize that there was anything such as criminal speeding until I called to take care of the fine over the phone and was informed that I would have to appear to plea. I was at a loss as to how to proceed and quickly decided I should have counsel. I searched Avvo and doing my due diligence made five phone calls to highly rated practices. My call to Kielsky and Rike was put through to Chris Rike and he explained the violation to me, what my options were, what the price would be and sent a follow up email. Interestingly all four of the other calls I made went unreturned. Given the good service and information given in the first call, I decided to retain Chris and his firm to represent me and I am extremely glad I did. 

After hiring Chris and giving him all the requested material and information he handled the rest. He was able to get everything done by phone and email and I did not have to appear in Santa Cruz County court. He kept me up to date at every point in the process. Given all the facts and information I was able to provide Chris, he was able to get my criminal speeding violation dismissed after taking online traffic school. This was the best outcome I could have hoped for. 

I would highly recommend Chris and his firm for this type of representation and would expect that they would be as diligent and helpful in any kind of litigation they are retained to do. I personally would like to thank Chris and his team for a job well done.",0,3,1

We were seated at a booth with white table cloth sprinkled with heart shaped confetti, which set a nice tone for our Valentine meal.  Then the chef sent out wonderful smoked salmon Hors d'oeuvres and an assortment of warm breads with seasoned butter.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful and we ordered the seared beef tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail, which has become our favorite and it was cooked to perfection. The potatoes au gratin are a must order along with the roasted wild mushrooms. We were pleasantly surprised with a beautiful red rose mid meal and it made the evening extra special.  We ordered crem brule for dessert. Yum!! Thank you again Cyndi, Brian, Nick and Stephanie for your gracious service and another memorable meal at Capital Grill.

1,"I saw the other reviews of this place and they compared the cheese rolls to Porto's, so I had to try it out. I went at around 2pm and they were sold out, but they can make them to order! They said it would take 15 min, but it was closer to 30 min. The rolls are a little smaller in size than Porto's, but they were worth the wait. It was piping hot, so you do have to let them cool down a little. This satisfied my Porto's craving, but Porto's still has the slight edge. I would suggest calling in your order so you don't have to wait. They also have cronuts, but were also sold out. They said they can make those to order also, so I will have to try that next time.

It's a bakery/Filipino restaurant, but it's a walk up counter. Very small inside with 4 tables. They serve ""silogs,"" so I may have to come back and try that out as well.",0,2,1

It's a great place to watch a ball game:air conditioned until it's cool enough to open the roof. They have a decent selection of concessions and drinks and there always seems to be some sort of venue close by. The HD Scoreboard is awesome. I 've never had to sit in the high seats so I can't promise that there's no bad seat in the house.  Just a nice modern venue to take in a game.

0,"We had lunch here recently and had a really good experience.  I was expecting a wait as the Yard House is usually really busy but we got seated right away.  Maybe lunch is less busy that dinner.  I was also pleasantly surprised that the music was not super loud.  I have been to the location at Town Square and you could barely have a conversation since the music was so loud.

I had the lunch portion of the shrimp rice bowl.  My mom had the half sandwich/soup combo with the pastrami sandwich and tomato soup.  Both of us enjoyed our meals.  My rice bowl had a lot of good veggies and about 5 shrimp.  It was a hearty portion even though it was the lunch sized portion.  Mom liked her sandwich and soup.  

Service was good.  The waitress came by often to check on us and refill our drinks.  If we can get in right away, have good food and good service again, I definitely will be back.",0,0,1
0,"We found this place on a Groupon binge during our drive in to Vegas. Bought a Groupon deal for $9 that takes $22 off of your tab. So, overall, you get $13 off? Does not seem as worth it when you do the actual math, but if you have a Dole Whip or two, you won't really care about math in the moment.

We came here at 4:30 on a Monday, i.e. as boring a time as you could ask for. We did not catch the bartender's name, but she made great drinks! Unfortunately, she was overworked and kept forgetting our orders and even forgot to deduct the discount from the Groupon. The stiff drinks more than made up for this. Despite this, she was very attentive and frequently asked us if we needed anything.

The entertainment on a Monday evening is minimal. Surf rock and island-themed videos on the TV. We did not really spend much time here, so I can't speak for what this place might be like during a more happening time. However, it was well worth what we spent on drinks.

6,"It was my second time visiting my boyfriend in Arizona and he happened  to take me here to explore. He told me Scottsdale is a bit higher class than other cities. I didn't believe him until I visited. 

The mall is big and filled with mostly fancy brands, like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Boss, Burberry and etc. 

If you experienced  South Coast Plaza, in Costa Mesa, CA,  you would know what I mean and how this mall would be like. It's filled with expensive stores. If i lived here, I would only come here during the weekends and when it's on sale. I'm not into super expensive stuff so I'll have to pass you expensive stores. 

I will give one star for being a mall, two stars for at least having some stores I can afford, three stars for the having fancy decoration, making the seats feel like hotel lobby feeling, and four for having restaurants that boyfriend and I can choose from. 

If you are at this mall, check out the awesome water drip staircase! It's pretty awesome walking down and up the stairs.

Many of the gelato/sorbet flavors are created with locally sourced ingredients, which is awesome, and they all tasted great -- they ahve some interesting flavors/combinations, and they load up the cup -- even the small is a lot for one person, so a big plus for not being stingy with the portions :)

I arrived at 1:30 PM and sat at the bar. The restaurant was not very busy, there was no wait list. I was front row in front of the kitchen. It was fun watching the friendly staff prepare pizzas and use the fire brick oven. 

I sipped on a Little Bird Sangria while I waited for the appetizer to arrive. My drink was delightful! A red sangria with fresh fruit. My appetizer, truffle cheese bread, arrived and looked as good as it tasted. House made bread topped with ricotta, provolone and fontina with a side of red sauce. The cheese was golden brown and the bread was firm yet delicate at the same time. 

Just when I think it couldn't get any better, it did! Lunch arrived! Half Rotisserie Chicken with Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. Ordering chicken comes with one side, but I couldn't resist. I had to get two. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful. The pasta in the Mac and Cheese was not overcooked and the cheese sauce was yummy. The Brussels sprouts were glazed and oven roasted, so freakin' good! I ordered Jalapeno Pesto sauce with my Chicken, it complimented the meal perfectly.

While yes it was expensive compared to some other hamburg joints, the food was above average. My wife and I both purchased the Burgerfi-Hamburger. I give the whole name because just beneath it is the Burgerfi-Cheeseburg. I was rather dumbfounded that the gal who took our order asked us if we wanted cheese on our hamburg! I did mentioned to her that if I had wanted a cheeseburg, I would have asked for the Burgerfi-Cheeseburg. Surprisingly my bit of sarcasm was lost on her. But if you notice that's the policy now at many places, asking you if you really want what you asked for. As I mentioned though, the food was good. We also got the onion rings. OMG, you only got about 8-9 on a large order, but they were HUGH ! Cooked just right, and very sweet. I'm not sure if it's just the onion that was the source of the sweetness, or if they use sugar in the batter coating. Either way, they were great! The burgers came with what they call their Burgerfi sauce. I wish I could give an opinion on  how it tasted, but they put on so little that I actually couldn't taste it.

1,"How does one ever choose which Vietnamese restaurant to go to when they are everywhere and their names are only differentiated by a number?  Because someone else must bring you there first, and that brings me to Pho Saigon 8.

A packed place on Saturday afternoon, a bit of a wait for our party of 7.  It gets a bit crowded by the front because people are waiting to be seated while other people wait to pay.  (Note: You pay at the register after your meal, so don't wait around at your table for the check 'cuz you won't get it.  Just remember your table number when you get to the register, otherwise you'll be one of those dorks who has to walk back to the table just to find out what your table number was.)

I had a typical bowl of pho with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Accompanied with it came the standard fresh bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, lemon, and jalapenos.  This place also provided some other leafy green to throw in, which is always a plus.  I don't mind the lemon, but sometimes I do like the lime in my soup though.  

Like all typical pho places, all the tableware is on the table for you to help yourself with.  However, this place only provides a limited amount of napkins, not the whole napkin dispenser like some of my other favorite pho places.  I can be messy, and my nose is constantly dripping from all the sriracha sauce I use, so I like to have an endless supply of napkins available for my disposal.  

Overall, a decent place.  Their menu is quite extensive, so you're bound to find something for everyone in here.  They even offer durian milkshakes, which is something you can't find or smell anywhere.  It gets crowded though, and to me, that's a good sign in a Vietnamese pho restaurant.

Update: 04/23/07 - Went back and tried their Com Ga Nuong hay Thit Nuong Cha Gio ($7.15), which is grilled chicken (or sliced pork) and egg rolls with steamed rice.  I replaced it with their French rice for a bit of variety.  I've been missing the five spice chicken rice plate from PPQ in San Francisco, so that's why I decided to try their version of chicken rice plate.  It was definitely disappointing!  No skin or much taste at all.  Service was blah, I had to ask for tea twice and it didn't show up until after my meal came.  By then, I didn't want my tea anymore.  I know not to try their chicken rice plate again.

Update! 10/10/07 - Brought some out of town guests for some pho and this was our safest bet for them.  I ordered 18. Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet (Small $6.35).  One friend really enjoyed the soup here.  He said it had a lot more flavor than some of the other pho joints he's been to, mostly in the South Bay.  We also ordered the 7. Banh Xeo ($7.50), also known as a Vietnamese pancake.  The crepe was lighter and crispier than the one I had at Pho Hung Restaurant, but it wasn't loaded as much.  It came with a mountain of greenery to eat with your crepe too.  You can't complain that they are being skimpy on the fresh veggie stuff, that's for sure!  The BF ordered 37. Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.00), which is beef stew served with a small baguette of French bread.  He likes to get this a lot at Vietnamese restaurants.  Another friend was really impressed that they offered red rice too since she rarely sees that on the menu.

I'll up their rating from a 3 to a 3.5.

0,"i recently purchased a used custom pool table from a couple who were moving out of state.  the day i looked at the table i decided to purchase it and immediately called On Cue Billiards to set-up delivery to my home.  when i was shopping around for a pool table, i had done some research on billiards services and these guys were on top of my list.

Kevin made scheduling the service quick and easy.  he was polite and and answered all of my questions without rushing me.  i had a few questions/concerns, since i had never owned a pool table before.  i even had to call him back a few times to reschedule a pick-up time that would be more convenient for the sellers.

on delivery day i received multiple calls from Josh and James to confirm the appointment.  they also called to let me know that they were ahead of schedule and were able to bump up my set-up time.  i checked with the sellers and they were ok with the new pick-up time.

Josh and James did an excellent job transporting the table to my game room upstairs.  before install, they made measurements to ensure the best placement for the table and made sure i was satisfied with it's location.  they also applied new felt on the table during install, which i decided to get done since it's cheaper to get re-felting done during installation.  they were very professional and thorough.  when they were finished, they gave me a bunch of tips regarding the care of my pool table.

1,"Eat here fairly regularly, on average once a week. The chicken on the rocks and the philly cheese steak are always a great choice. Pricing is in keeping with what you'd expect from a shawarma joint, and the food has been consistently tasty every time I've been there. 

On the downside however because it's become so popular the wait can be a bit on the long side (sometimes approaching or exceeding 10 minutes) but that would be about the only complaint and in truth not a big issue at all. It seems to be mostly takeout although dining in would be fine as well I suppose. 

Very similar in menu and taste to Osmow's - was told the owner was a partner at Osmow's before (no idea if that's true or not)

The secret is in the consistent quality and freshness of the food (they're busy with a high turnover so you know the food is fresh and tastes that way) the sauces are also good but be mindful if you order something spicy if you're not prepared for it!

Great place and will continue to be a regular customer",0,0,1
0,"Had a truly wonderful meal, start to finish at Echo and Rig. Our table of 6 ordered a variety of menu options, including a massive tomahawk, the Spencer steak, burgers and chicken sandwiches. The food was delicious and very appropriately priced. Service was excellent; prompt, polite and attentive without being obnoxious or overbearing. Good cocktails as well. It was not an inexpensive meal, but your money is well-spent here, as you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a good off-strip steakhouse, E&R will be tough to beat.

My only gripe, and this is minimal, is that they don't accept reservations. We arrived at 7:15 with a party of six and were told that our wait would be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. This makes it very difficult to plan an evening if you're trying to get somewhere on a schedule (e.g., movies). They also have a very non-modern system of table tracking that adds to the unpredictability.  With the great bar and cocktails, this is not a deterrent to return, but I will definitely plan accordingly next time.",0,0,1
0,"This gets my vote for the best AYCE BBQ in the GTA now. I usually frown upon ""fake"" Japanese places owned by Chinese. While it is run by Chinese, I would say they have done a very good job to mimic the style. They play Japanese pop songs and put Japanese posters and pictures on the wall. Looks nice!

Food: 
The meats are cut into very small pieces, which is something I like because it cooks really fast and you don't have to worry if the center is ready. The quality of short ribs is definitely a step up from Chako and of course Korean Grill House. There is some nice marbling that is visible on the meat. The meat is so tender and I really like that it's lightly seasoned, unlike Chako/KGH which is swimming in sauce to compensate for the quality of meats. Good cuts of beef don't need much seasoning! And I love how the shrimps are peeled! Easy to eat!

The honey sweet potato is a must try! All the other veggies were meh as they are pretty dry and bland for BBQing but I can let that slide since I came for meat. The ""beef brisket"" was more like bulgogi. Not too special. I don't recommend the chicken. The few appetizers were just ok. I don't recommend the bibimbap as they don't even serve it with pepper sauce. And the portion is somewhat large and I feel it doesn't fit well into their menu. Cold noodle is just ""ok"". 

At the end you can get creme brulee and a melona bar. Unique choices! I would love to have ice cream though but again, not a big deal for me.

Service:
For once I feel a Chinese run place has provided good service. Although obviously not native Japanese speakers, the staff will welcome you in Japanese. The server we had was attentive and helped to make sure we were cooking alright. I really appreciate the efforts. I read some bad reviews about service. I guess it depends on your server.

Price: It's $30 PP on weekday and +$3 on weekends, which is significantly higher than other AYCE options. But well worth it. Will be back.",0,0,1

3,"This place just opened last year on St. Clair West near Rushton so my wife and I decided to check it out.

PROP stands for the People's Republic of Pasta, which is cute and evocative but I think doesn't do the place justice. Some really interesting and yummy dishes here, and the menu is enticing and makes me want to go back a second time.

I had the Bucatini with pancetta and spicy tomato sauce. SO GOOD. The pasta was done perfectly and the sauce simple but flavorful.

My wife had the Risotto special, the ingredients of which escape me right now but it was also fantastic.

The starter was a cheesy bread with prosciutto, I couldn't eat much of it, but it tasted great.

It was highly affordable, the wine selection was decent for my tastes, and it was an enjoyable evening.

Cons: It was a bit cold in there, wish they had the heat on a bit, the service was a bit slow, as they were catering to a group of really obnoxiously loud people, which also ruined the experience a bit. But whatever, no big deal.

We'll be going back for sure.",0,3,1

What the creative team behind this terrifying attraction have been able to do every year is nothing short of remarkable. Awesomely detailed sets and for 2013 a couple of brand new surprises, including a completely redesigned lobby just go to show that they're never happy and always trying to up their game.

The new parking system that has people being shuttled over from the Pittsburgh Zoo parking lot seems to be working really well and the addition of timed entry tickets also is helping with the lines (which could get insane in the past). Definitely buy your tickets online so you can take advantage of that and if you think it's going to be really busy? Check out the RIP option, could be worth it depending on the crowds that night.

My lease just ended at Canyon Crossroads and I have nothing but good things to say about Valerie and Monica. My entire experience at Canyon Crossroads was nothing but 5-Star.

Movie theatre on site as well! Parking was never an issue- some nights I had to park down the way but never far. I highly recommend! 



***ORIGINAL REVIEW***
I moved to Canyon Crossroads from out of state approx 3 months ago. Before visiting the property, I read the google reviews and was extremely hesitant. My first day looking at the apartments, I knew the previous reviews couldn't be right. The community is quiet, there is hardly any parking ""issues"" the space is very clean and well taken care off. The complex has a clubhouse, resort style pool, outdoor clubhouse with TV, outdoor seating, and a fireplace, fitness center and a movie theatre with incline seating. The office has 3 office ladies who are friendly and very attentive. The views from my unit directly face the mountains and it couldn't get better. I gladly drive 25 miles to work just to live here. If you're interested in Canyon Crossroads, go take a visit! You will see what I mean!",0,1,1
0,"This may be the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food I've ever had.

I found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area, and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews. My boyfriend and I have been there for dinner twice now, and attempted a third time but arrived too late because I forgot that they close at 8pm :( One of the only negative things about the place so far. I think they should stay open until at least 9PM, but oh well.

I've read numerous comments about poor service but both times I've been, service has been just fine. Maybe a little on the slow side regarding the check, but I can let that slide as I was not in a hurry to leave either time. The ambiance is not romantic or necessarily inviting, but it's charming in its own way.

I found it a little strange that they charge for chips and salsa ($1), but it's a small price to pay, as the chips were very fresh and the salsa (both the salsa served with the chips, and the bottled hot sauce) was quite good. I think both times I've eaten at El Bravo, I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner special served with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, tomato and rice and beans on the side. The chimichanga was AMAZING. Flavorful, juicy, tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla. The toppings were a little overwhelming, next time I may ask for them on the side. The rice and beans both had good flavor and I was very satisfied with the whole meal. I thought the little crispy flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar which was brought with the check was a very nice way to end the meal.

I was really craving a Pina Colada, but they do not have coconut, so I ordered a Peach Bellini, the Italian take on a blended alcoholic beverage instead.  My husband had a Ginger Beer style beverage, which I found to be quite sour, but he liked it.  We ordered a couple appetizers to start with- Bandera bread, and Jalapeno Shrimp Thai Bites.  

The bread was a basic cheese bread, with a salsa ranch for dipping, so its something that almost anyone would enjoy.  I liked the shrimp, because it was spicy and sweet.  Its great that the shrimp are served on a bed of shredded carrots, green onion and lettuce, and my husband ate it after like a salad.  Hehe

1,"I have to give huge kudos to the Nordstrom Department Store.  I have rarely ever gone in there before, but one of my daughters wanted a particular leather jacket for Christmas.  I went to the store itself, but they did not have this particular jacket in the store, so the clerk ""cheerfully"" looked it up for me online and ordered it for me.  She gave me all the information I needed and this was in a very timely manner by the way.  Christmas came and my daughter opened her gift and the jacket did not fit.  Of course I kept my receipt, so we took it back to the same Nordstrom store that I got it from and told them we needed to return it and order the jacket one size larger.  Again, the clerk did this transaction within five minutes ""cheerfully"" and it was taken care of.  This was a different clerk too.  

As of today, my daughter had not received the jacket yet and was concerned, so since I still have the receipt, I called Nordstrom and spoke with Customer Service.  The person I spoke with actually made my day and made me ""Happy"".  She was so sweet and I gave her all the information from my receipt and she actually tracked the jacket for me.

I went there specifically for the Chocolate Cherry Baileys since this was the closest and most convenient location to where I work or where I live. I took the bus 24 to get there from downtown during my lunch.

The prices are regulated so whatever they sell in this store, if they have it at a different SAQ store will be the exact same price.

1,"I'm writing specifically about the Nordstrom cafe. Been going here about 15 years. I loved it way more back then - better soups, better service and WAY better prices.  The food is still pretty good, but my favorites have all  been discontinued. I recommend the tomato soup, the crusty bread that comes with and the apple, goat cheese, chicken salad!

The service is usually good, but not always like it used to be. Had a problem with a kind of surly guy in the soup area and had to speak to a manager. She made it better and made it up to me, it is just sad that someone with that attitude could even be in the Cafe. Would not have happened in the old days. My biggest gripe is the cost. Their prices have just surged in recent years. $3.25 for a lousy fountain soda?  Almost $15 for a salad and I just found out the full size really just has more lettuce than anything the half order has.

The atmosphere is good, but realize that you need to leave a tip for the guys that come take your tray away or ask you if you need a soda refill. Adding that on top of their elevated prices makes this place an expensive lunch! Expect to pay $20 plus",0,1,1

4,"It took me almost two years to find good Mexican food. A coworker had been telling us about this place for months. Actually the one on central but this one is just much closer for us.

Our first visit was impromptu and definitely worth it. We had ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. It took a while for it come out but once it came out, I understood why. They definitely made it fresh and it had big colossal size shrimp. The shrimp were even a little warm still. The base of the cocktail was a little sweeter than I'm used to but still delicious. Get this, you won't be disappointed. My main meal was the jalisciences which is an enchilada with a steak on top. Omg, I can't tell you how happy I was eating this. Seasoned and cooked perfectly. It had these pan fried potatoes that I couldn't stop eating. I wanted more. My steak was cooked medium, tender and full of flavor. 

On our most recent visit we did the nachos for our appetizer and these were good too. Topped with shredded chicken, lettuce, crema and Fresca queso. I didn't finish it because I'm not a fan of refried beans on my nachos but still pretty good. 

I also ordered the seafood soup and I had to wait for a bit for this to come out. Our server did not initially tell us it would take a little longer for this meal but since we were grubbing on nachos I didn't mind. They did eventually let me know and asked if I wanted them to bring my son's food out now or wait. So that was nice and considerate of them. But upon arrival of my food, I could smell the aroma and it was delightful. The first spoon of broth made my mouth sing a joyous harmony. It is that good. It had tilapia, clams, mussels, octopus, shrimp and squid. The only thing I was missing was a side of corn tortillas but I asked for some and they brought some out quickly. 

So overall, I've been extremely happy every time we dine here. The servers are always professional, polite and take good care of you without being overbearing. 

The food is made with love ya'll. Hands down the best Mexican food in Charlotte. It's always fresh and some of the most flavorful food I have had.",2,2,1

0,"Once upon a time, I moved here from Minnesota.  The best Philly's I found in MN were from a gas station.  In fact, two different places served up amazing ones in gas stations.  So I don't know why I would doubt that the best Philly's would be in a gas station here.  

There are not words to adequately describe the pleasure of eating one of their Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches.  No it's still not as good as the real thing in Philadelphia, but it is as close as I've had especially out here.  The pricing is so cheap, and if you're really hungry they offer a 24 inch option.  Yes that's 2 feet of amazing deliciousness!  

It's easy to miss this place, as it is located inside the gas station.  However if you're hungry don't overlook this amazing establishment.  

The bread was full of flavor, the steak was cooked well and mixed great on the griddle with the peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  The steak was full of flavor, and the toppings were a perfect addition.  The first bite was like meeting an amazing memory of taste of the best cheesesteaks I've had in my life.  Subsequent bites were enough to convince me that I will be back whenever I'm looking for a cheesesteak.

The only downer- though the gas station is always open, the Cheesesteak shop is not.  You have to catch this deliciousness between ""normal"" lunch and dinner hours.  Sadly they're not open at 5am when I'm getting out of work and looking for a quality cheesesteak.",0,0,1

2,"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with a party of five and we had no trouble with seating. The place is small but comfortable and clean.

I came in with low expectations for the desserts but was pleasantly surprised. I had the mango shaved ice bowl. It was a nicely balanced and didn't taste too sweet. It was refreshing and I finished it myself. I really like the mango balls that pop in your mouth and the little piece of cake on the top added to the textures in the bowl. My bill was about $15 with tip, which seemed fair given the atmosphere, location etc. I think there are better dessert places in Markham, but this is the only one of its kind here and Yonge and Egg desperately needed a place like this.

My friend tried the grape shaved ice bowl, which had vanilla shaved ice, unlike the mango and strawberry flavours. For those who don't want dessert, there are quite a few savory food options on the menu like chicken wings and the baked dishes you find at HK cafes. I was hoping for some hot coffee, but they don't have any.

4,"Sage was the scene for our ""rehearsal"" dinner with family and friends who'd journeyed out to Las Vegas for Carol W and my wedding.  A month prior to our arrival, I'd called Sage to make reservations for a large party of 15-16 people.  I was very surprised when the person I spoke with at Sage was so nonchalant (in a good way) about my request, not asking for a credit card number to hold the reservation, just saying, ""We'll see you on Jan 10th.""  The only contact I received from the restaurant was a confirmation call made to me the day of a few hours before our reservation time.  Sage was picked for this momentous occasion because we'd both eaten and had drinks there on a couple of previous trips to LV and had been suitably impressed by its contemporary American cuisine and killer cocktails.  More importantly, our party consisted of diners of varying levels of sophistication and adventurousness, but we knew that Sage had accessible food that virtually anyone could find something they would eat and enjoy.  This time was no different and, in fact, was its best showing to date.

Our party of 15 arrived a few minutes prior to our 7:30pm reservations.  We were seated at a long table at the back of the restaurant partially sectioned off from the main dining room.  I don't know if Sage has private dining rooms, but our table worked perfectly for us as the noise level from the full house of diners never rose above average to intrude on our meal.

Given the diverse tastes of our party and our planned budget, we opted for the Signature Tasting Menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sage-las-vegas-2?select=iYda89NQBM3fTPcNBQzBeg#iYda89NQBM3fTPcNBQzBeg) Without getting into specifics for each course as every item on the tasting menu was ordered by someone at our table, everyone pushed back from the table satisfied and pleased with what they had received.  However, the Foie Gras Brulee, the Grilled Spanish Octopus, 48 Hour Beef Belly, and both dessert selections seemed to receive the highest praise.  Our lead server, Lauren, did an amazing job synchronizing her team in keeping everyone's order straight; delivering our food simultaneously; keeping the water, wine, and cocktails flowing; and even coordinating with the kitchen to accommodate two of our party's special requests to substitute items on menu.  It was an exemplary performance by the kitchen, service staff, and sommelier.  Sage delivered everything we had hoped for and more in a special occasion meal!  I recommend Sage 100 percent for your special occasion, especially if you're celebrating it with a large group.",0,3,1

The salad bar has mostly what you'd expect at such a place. A good selection of green leafy vegetables is what I recommend because it's healthy and keeps you from filling up too much before the good stuff. The cold mushrooms and asparagus are both decent options. They have those spicy little red peppers that I enjoy, as well as a decent selection of cheeses. 

The mashed potatoes side arrived shortly and wasn't extraordinary but decent. Once the meat began to arrive, it was pretty relentless. I loved the sirloin steak, medium or less. The Flank steak was surprisingly juicy and tasty as well. I love that they often offer multiple levels of cooked for the customers, and if you want something rare that they don't have, they will simply make some more for you promptly. You'll want to try the lamb steak but the lamb chop wasn't particularly impressive. I probably ate 3 orders of the signature fogo cut, which has just the right amount of pink throughout the cut. The garlic sirloin is also delectable, without being overly flavored. I went crazy for the rib eye just as I was reaching maximum fullness.

The service is very good here-- they seem to take their reputation seriously as the premier Brazillian BBQ in clark county and they treat you with respect and care. You won't find better in this town, and hence they get the 5 stars.",0,0,1

The humble spot offers poutines that will surely make you smile. I ordered the traditional with extra gravy to see what this spot was all about. It was outstanding. The fries were fresh, piping hot, and retained their crispiness throughout the entire eating process (not going to lie though, it was devoured rather quickly). They were well seasoned - not too much, not too little. The cheese curds used were perfectly squeaky and remained their wonderful texture despite the piping hot gravy. It was a more than generous portion of fries and cheese. 
The gravy was definitely one of the best poutine gravies I have had in an extremely long time. I appreciated how generous they ladled on the gravy when I asked for extra, as usually I find they don't put as much as I like (I like a LOT of gravy). The taste was wonderful and complimented the seasoned fries and cheese curds. It was a great consistency - not thick or goopy and not thin or runny. Literally just right.

I also love their Savory crepes and order those sometimes too to mix it up with the sugary items. 
Prices are slightly higher then what I'd like to pay for dessert but it's worth it.

3,"Did End of the Line (the subway one), Prison Break,  Haunting of Noriko. Passed all of them but still challenging 

Highly recommend prison break for beginners and big group it's really fun and active.  
Haunting of Noriko was a favourite. 2 floors,  very well made Soooo scary and very fun and amazingly designed like the best escape room I've ever been. I was scared but I have to admit the room was so good (just go with a huge group) 

Escape games has board game free to play while waiting.  Staff are very nice and very professional here,  really impressed with all the rooms (coming back for more).  They really put in detail and care in making each room :)

Once we sat down it took no time at all and our food was there. It was by far one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the one with harvati cheese, sautéd onions and lettuce. My friend got the ahi tuna burger and raved about how good it was. Both burgers came with fries which were amazingly seasoned and we got an order of the market carrots with a pesto sauce, cheese etc- really great. I would go back in a heartbeat.",0,0,1
1,"My husband and I came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and everything about our evening at George was just perfect! We had the blind 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. We both got something different for each course so it was like tasting 10 different dishes. The food was just spectacular and the paired wines were beautiful. Service was impeccable and each course came out in a timely fashion (we never felt rushed nor did we ever feel like we were waiting too long) with each server giving a full explanation of what was on our plates. A Sommelier would follow as soon as each course was presented and tell us all about the wines and the reason why they pair so well with the  particular dishes (very nice & friendly guy btw!). It was all such an experience & we felt very pampered! I had mentioned when booking that it was our anniversary and as soon as we walked in the door, every staff member we encountered wished us a happy anniversary (it was also written on our dessert plates). The space itself is gorgeous with a very intimate feel. I especially appreciated the space we had both at our table & between the tables (a rare blessing in downtown Toronto restaurants). It was expensive yes, but we both felt like it was well worth it for the special occasion.",0,0,1

For an entree, I got the cioppino and was brought out a bib (necessary) and a bowl for shells (cleaned ever 5 minutes). It was second to my favorite place for cioppino in San Francisco, but delicious nonetheless. My husband got the swordfish and really enjoyed as well. It felt very intimate, despite the size of the restaurant and all service, from the hostess (who gave me a black napkin since I was wearing black), to David, to the young man who brought over an 8 pound live crab just so we could look at it.

Quick bar seating.  After big games, events, or during busy hours seating takes about 20-40 minutes and the wait for pizza can be up to an hour.  We were lucky and got in fast before the rush and were able to get our food in a descent amount of time.  
I was wanting a calzone and they don't have them. I asked if I could get creative and make one pizza style. Done with ease and no rolled eyes. One thin crust with ricotta, meatballs, sausage and cheese topping. It was amazing!!!  The meatballs were tasty and not some nasty, frozen packaged meatball and if they were.....we couldn't tell.  My husband' pizza was good but he was sad after seeing and trying mine. It's not the restaurant's fault that I chose/made a better pizza so I can't take away a star.
Prices are a little high but not for The Vegas Strip.",0,1,1
0,"Another top Toronto resto... this place quite literally blew my mind. Quite deserving of the 5 star rating
Very cool spot with a dumpling bar upstairs. Decor is very interesting - just don't sit in the corner window seat - the air conditioning vent blows down on that area - we had to move it was uncomfortably cold! 

Food was TOP TOP TOP

We ordered a la carte, although the restaurant does offer a chef's selection of dishes by which they showcase a selection of well-paired dishes. 

We started with a chefs daily special which was a mushroom and watercress salad with puffed rice and soft boiled quail eggs... this really set the meal off right and was truly, uniquely mouth-watering. 

Both the green pea and hakka brown wontons were so flavourful and one of the top orders of our meal

Seared nappa cabbage was probably the only item we selected that, although good, didnt live up to the rest of the meal

Whole Fried Giggie trout - very, very good with some different dipping sauces, each unique and tasty

Truffle fried rice - the spicy XO sauce they use for this dish is bomb! So good. 

Finished with the champonado chocolate pudding with puffed rice and white rabbit candy ice cream... which, was probably one of the best desserts i've had in the city. So delectable.",0,0,1

9,"While the emphasis at Lola Rosa is vegetarian rather than vegan, they do accommodate those of us who eschew cheese and eggs quite well. I tried both Lola locations and much prefer the location on Avenue du Parc because I prefer the ambiance. The space is larger and it's not quite as loud. The menu differs from location to location (more vegan options at Lola Rosa Parc). That said, both restaurants employ lovely staff who are accommodating and attentive. They are doing something right!

If you come on in the evening, do make reservations at this location. I arrived at 9pm and the entire place was packed, save for one table, the one we had reserved. Not only was it packed, but as I mentioned before, extremely loud, to the point where we pretty much were shouting at each other (and, unfortunately, the waitress. I hate being rude). I much preferred the place an hour later when the crowd had left. 

On to the menu... it's well-edited. Nothing too creative or out of this world about it, which isn't always a bad thing. I ordered the soup of the day, which was a curried chickpea soup. I didn't love it, didn't hate it. I'm not a fan of completely pureed soups in general and this also needed salt. Next up, the tacos. What is really outstanding about them is the seitan, which is perfectly chewy without being rubbery and bursting with flavor. Seitan is often so bland and boring. This is the great kind! I just wish there was more of it in the tacos. 

Lola Rosa Parc has out-of-this-world phenomenal chickpea fries. I mean... the kind of fries that you're compelled to burn your mouth on. This location does not have them. I love those fries so much that I'm mentioning them in a review for Lola Rosa Milton, so there ya go!

But what that other location doesn't have that this one does have is the Twix bar vegan dessert... a dessert in a league (or paragraph) of its own! Normally I'm too full from dinner to order dessert, but to be honest, I wasn't really in love with anything I ordered so room, I had aplenty and that's kind of serendipitous because this dessert is that insanely good.",3,9,1

0,"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Henderson / Green Valley. Everything I've tasted on their menu has been spectacular. They have plenty of options for your sweet (strawberry shortcake French toast, or peaches and cream pancake) or savory (croque madame or tacos huevos) cravings, and they offer gluten-free versions of many of their dishes. Their Mexican Hot Chocolate with torch-blown marshmallows is as beautiful as it is delicious (see attached photo), and their ""Social Bucket"" of champagne (one bottle, your choice of juice, and as many glasses as you can fill) is the perfect way to start off your meal with friends. 

A warning: this place is ALWAYS busy on the weekends. However, you can join the waiting list through Yelp! so that you do not have to physically be at the restaurant in order to get in line. If you use this feature, though, you are still required to check in with the hostess once you arrive. My only complaint with this is that they often times give you a 20-ish minute window of time for when you will be seated, and you are seated towards the end of that window (if not a bit beyond it) more often than not. But that's what happens when you decide to dine at one of the best breakfast / brunch places in town (and it sure beats not getting on the waiting list at all, and having to wait for a full hour or more to be seated)!",0,1,1

After a long day, I wasn't ready to navigate this place but the staff were very friendly and accommodating.

One is that the chicken croquettes are excellent, and not at all what I was expecting.  It's crispy and firm, but when you bite into it's like you just had a spoonful of soup.  It's was surprising for the first bite, as it is creamy and does not have the solid consistency you expect when you bit into it, but once you accept the oddity of it, it's really good.  

Two is that the sangria is really, really good.  Get the one with champagne in it.",0,0,1

Now that I'm older, I go in for the awesome sandwiches. It's such a treat to get the chicken salad or just plain old turkey and cheese on a pretzel bun.

I built my own crepe with green tea ice cream, Nutella, and mochi, which was delicious! The crepe here was softer than other Japanese crepes I've had before (which were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside), but this one was still good. Only complaint I have is that most of my mochi ended up in the very bottom of my crepe, instead of being more evenly spread out.

14,"Inside the Rivers Casino there are several restaurants, Andrew's Steakhouse being the 'High-End"" restaurant among them. We have been here oh, I'll just say numerous times, including fourth of July to eat and watch the fireworks. 

How do you see the fireworks, well the backside of the restaurant is all floor to ceiling windows looking out over, across, up and down the river. Also there is a backside patio dining area under cover but with outstanding views including up the Mt. Washington hillside. In this warm months this is a very pleasant or even perhaps an outstanding al fresco dining scene.

So what do I like best here; the food and views.
And the least, a bit noisy from the casino and intermittently slow service.

Our usual starting place would be the Bluepoint oysters on the half shell, which are always nicely presented and tasting fresh out of the water. They are accompanied by Cocktail sauce, Mignonette, and Horseradish sauce. Some of our other favorite starters are the French Onion Soup with Applejack Brandy, and Calamari which is served with Lemon Aioli and Arrabbiata sauce dipping which has a nice complexity and heat to it. The Calamari is delicious and very tender.

We alternate between the salads all of which are pretty good. I especially enjoy the beet salad. This has read and yellow roasted baby beets, with goat cheese, frisee and arugula and a Sherry vinegar reduction. These flavors all work together so nicely.

So far, we have not tried the seafood, chicken or burgers. But the Steaks, Prime rib and the Lamb are what we are drawn to.

The Bone In Ribeye done medium rare is just bursting with flavor and practically melts in your mouth. This is an outstanding steak, one which I come back for often.
Linda loves the Rack of Lamb. This Lamb is mild, tender, beautifully prepared and very delicious for you lamb lovers. We have had Lamb all over the country and this stands up to the best we have had including Jamison Farms (actually from here in Latrobe, but served around the country in the best restaurants, and Elysian Fields (also local to Green county and served in around the United States). Example, Thomas Keller famed Chef of the French Laundry in California serves Pennsylvania Lamb.

One other item worthy of note, there is a very great bar in here with seating and several High-top tables. Overall this is a very good choice if you are seeking the high-end steakhouse kind of dinner and experience. I think the Ribeye here might be the best int he city.",6,11,1

Food:I ordered the shrimp boil with the Wu's Seasoning.It was flavorful including the corn,potatoes,and sausage. I like how you have the option to select different types of seasoning/butter sauce. Now,I would say if you are from somewhere wherein shrimp boils is common then this may not meet your higher expectations.However,I still found it to be satisfying.

Drinks:They have a couple of unique drinks.We ordered some type of sangria with fresh berries which I enjoyed.

Parking Lot:The parking is annoying as there is limited parking in front of the restaurant.The actual parking spots are tight too.

Customer Service:Acceptable,no complaints

Decor:It is so cute in there!I love the variation of decor.There are also plenty of large TVs available.

Cost:Appropriate,I didn't find anything to be overpriced.

Setting:I love the music selection.I found myself singing away as I was eating my food which just really created a nice setting in my eyes.

Overall,I'll return!",0,0,1
2,"It defiantly doesn't look like much from the outside, and once you walk in its a decent size space but it's usually pretty empty. The set up is ok. The owners wife is the cashier and she has her son with her. He's a boys boy, and defiantly likes to play. I had my two year old daughter with me, and I'm sure people don't like being bothered by kids they don't know. I could tell by how the mother kept nervously telling her son to be nice and to leave my daughter alone. I thought it was cute, she's only two and the little boy is four. I enjoyed him keeping my daughter busy while we were waiting for the food. The food came out pretty quick and tasted good! The prices are great too. I will probably go back. :) defiantly a child friendly restaurant, which can be hard to come by on the eastside.",1,1,1
1,"Have lived in  Vegas  for  2 years.  Been  in  the Miracle  Mile shops before and saw Ketchup.  It looked like a fun place but wasn't craving a burger.  Amazon  Local had a deal for it so I  thought I would take advantage while  my wife and Kids were out of town.  I had $22 to spend so I was sat at the bar (of course).  Cheryl was the bartender and very enthusiastic.  She recommended the burger and beer deal for $10.  Sounded good to me (although I had to add bacon to it).  So I have only spend $10 of $22 at this point so I am doing great.  Added on $3 fries. $13.  I still have $9.  Cocktail I say.  Whiskey Sour please.  Cheryl says that is $10 or $10 with a souvenir cup same quantity of booze.  But I can bring it back and get a drink in it for $5.  Deal.  Ok so I am at $23 bucks not bad.  1/2 way through the experience I show her my Amazon deal.  She says that due to the Burger and Beer Deal I can't get that discounted.  Oh crap I should have mentioned this when I first sat down.  My fault.  Ended up using the $10 to get 2 32oz PBR's.  So I spent a little more than I wanted to but I was definitely ""buzzed"" after that experience.  The burger was good and the Cheryl was hilarious.  A lot of people had Groupons  and Amazon Local deals (hope they mention it first thing).  I will be back even without a deal",1,1,1

Wow what a difference!  It was very busy so we sat at the bar.  I had the pork sandwich with cole slaw and fries.  My wife had the brisket with hush puppies.  Everything was great!  Fast service too.  We took a few hush puppies home and our dog loved them too.  My only complaint is they don't have a variety of sauces available in self service bottles.

3,"Ran a train on these rolls, cuz it was ALL YOU CAN EAT!

I decided to give this place a go, since I wasn't in the mood to shell out 50 bucks for a hotel mediocre buffet on the strip. Since I had a car, we decided to venture off strip to find some good eats. The group decided on Yama Sushi. 

We showed up around 7:00 pm on a Saturday night. There was a line out the door and a 1 hour wait. By the time we sat down, I was already gnawing on my arm. I was ready to pig out. I looked around for the buffet station and saw none. It turns out, you have to order the items individually. Son-of-B... I thought the food was going to take another 30 minutes to prepare, so I was apologizing to my hungry friends. However, within 2 minutes of ordering, our food already started to come out. We must of tried at least 16 rolls, 8 types of sushi, 10 different appetizers and all of the mochi ice cream. I actually don't remember what I ate, since there was just a blur of hands going from the table to my mouth. Everything that we had was delicious, with the expectation of the edamame and yakitori (chicken skewers). 

The place is really cramped, crowded, and dimly lit. It's also not that expensive. 

A little about my credentials:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italia n Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I continue to enjoy & love food.",8,3,1

Graft is a beautiful restaurant worthy of fine dining, but unpretentious and welcoming. There were definitely a few suits and couture dresses, but I saw jeans and sweatshirts too.

We started with a couple cocktails and Beef Tartare. Right away I knew we were in for a special dining experience. Despite only having a few ingredients tartare is difficult to execute properly. 

I won't bore you by detailing each item we devoured, but use my pics as a dining guide. The only item that didn't blow me away was the Half Chicken. I rarely order roasted chicken at restaurants, but this was touted as a signature dish. I found it lacking in flavor, but tender and juicy. Not bad, but I wouldn't reorder. We were so full by the time it came out we weren't too disappointed. It was still a solid dish.

If nothing else YOU MUST order the Blueberry-Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake!! This is easily the best cheesecake I've had and a top dessert ever.

Going with four stars because Dr. Jacks is wonderful but the office needs work and care. New books for the individual patient rooms is a must, as well.

Tastes like home-cooking, and the food is good-looking and colorful with fresh vegetables. Kung Pao Chicken (on the menu) is similar to the Szechuan, and is also made with generous slices of white meat chicken.

0,"I love this course. A lot has seemed to change since about some of the reviews, much of it for the better. I have golfed here several times and never seen any homeless people; hopefully that means they have moved miles away. 
The majority of the course looks very green. There is no guarantee at any course that you will hit the ball in a spot that is easy to hit from, so the excuse of ""the grass is too this"" or ""that"" will apply at any course, not just this one. This course is better than the courses the pros use because the golfers still get the same difficult shots as the pros, and it is much cheaper  (perspective is key).
The prices may be different than the previous reviews. It may be a coincidence, but every time I have gone golfing here the price has been $5 per golfer and $5 for a golf cart. Also, I have never had tee time, but never had to wait more than five minutes before teeing off.
There is no longer a messy porta potty. Unfortunately that is because there is no longer a porta potty. (Therefore you may want to make yourself go a couple minutes before tee time. I have golf scores in the double digits on holes meaning it probably takes me longer than most golfers to finish the 9 holes, but I am still fast enough to finish before needing to go, no matter how much water I drink.)

0,"Service is a little slow so far, but it's a full house for all you can eat lunch!

The thing about Sushi (in general) is that it's one of those things that's really easy to not get wrong, bu really difficult to get right. Sushi Mountain All you can Eat is simply a gorge yourself style menu with a very affordable price point, and although the Sushi quality is mediocre, the value is very good and balances out the experience. A full course, choose your own lunch is $15 tax in.   

I had some beef with the service (no pun intended) over some very simple things that were overlooked. For example, I found that despite how many plates I ate through and the frequent passing by's from the servers, my empty plates were left to chill out on the table. I ended up arranging them into a convenient little stack before they were finally noticed and removed. Also I found both the Dynamite and Kamakazie Rolls to be very loose and assembled haphazardly. I do understand that it is the lunch rush, but it is still worth mentioning. 

The ingredients are nothing exotic and have the more high quality items you would expect to find such as bamboo, eel, and oyster mushrooms omitted from the menu and subsequent dishes. All that being said, an All-You-Can-Eat Sushi restaurant that is local is something that every sushi loving restaurant goer likes to have in their array of known eateries, this one is mine and I will be going back.

0,"I loved this restaurant. I was very impressed by their menu with a lot of unique dishes. It has a cheese plate with a good selection of cheese in their dessert menu, which is a difinetely a plus for me as a cheese lover. 

Alhough we fanced their pizza and pasta menu, we went for Ahi Tuna burger and Magic mashroom burger. They were served with green salad. The ahi was cooked just right and all ingredients in the vegie burger were creating a nice harmony. The dressing on the salad was nice and it was not a typical side salad.

For dessert, we ordered banana churro which had nice banana cream inside with vanilla bean icecream on the side. 

I've tried so many restaurants all over the world but Brick is one of the best in terms of the food. As for the service, we had to wait for a while for our waiter to come back a few times but he was very friendly and professional. I think the chef really knows how to cook and combine different ingredients. Their food is cooked in a healthy way too. So I will go back to this restaurant soon.",0,0,1
3,"Cozy, classy atmosphere...idyllic little back patio...wonderful Italian cuisine...prompt and friendly service. How have I never been here before?

If the weather cooperates, I recommend sitting out back on the patio, which is bathed in leafy greenery and accented with a full-sized Greek statue. Very pretty!

Before the meal as we sipped on cocktails, they offered us delicious complimentary bruschetta and a plate of olives and cheese. Very generous indeed.

For an appetizer, I recommend the sauteed shrimps in a tomato cream sauce. Delish.

For my entree I chose the ""Hotel De Paris"" which is an unusual combination of veal piccata (veal scallopini served with a lemon/butter/white wine sauce) alongside slices of grilled salmon, accompanied by grilled veggies. Wonderful dish!!

My companion ordered a lamb special, cooked with arugala and parmesan cheese, which was also lovely.

Looking for a quality, romantic night out? This is it!

I liked that they were a true farm-to-table place...food, service, and ambiance were all top notch.

For starters, their bartenders are solid.  I am a gin fan, and opted to roll the dice and let the bartender make something.  He ended up doing a riff on a Last Word and a Negroni called a Bijoux.  It was fantastic.

Food-wise, I went with the warm quinoa and kale salad with a side of cheese curds...both were great.  My server, Trent, said that the curds were a Wisconsin  ""right of passage"".  I am glad I opted to walk, I felt less guilty eating them all....because ""cardio"".

However, on my most recent visit, we were greeted by 3 people I hadn't seen before, and they were all amazing! Very attentive, friendly, and on the ball. I got a regular Sumatra coffee, and it by itself was awesome, which says a lot. The new gluten free vegan sweet potato cookies were pretty tasty, too!

Some may say that it's not as good as other big festivals and blah blah blah... But if it serves its purpose and makes you laugh while getting a dose of life theater at the same time, how could it be wrong?

Various acts from around the valley (not just Torch Theatre) perform and even some from other cities. This year saw troupes from LA, Chicago, Detroit, and more. There's even a family friendly showcase!!

I enjoyed the Strawberry Matcha Latte which was sweet and delicious and I got to pick my own light bulb for it to be in. 

As I was about to leave, a kind woman came out from the back and stopped me from leaving so I could get a free sample of these ""Warm Candied Sweet Potato and Taro"" that she has just made. She let me know that the snack was something new that they were trying out and may possibly have on the menu in the future. I kind of just took them, said thank you and went on my merry way. As I got to my car I started eating the sample and WOW... what a tasty treat! I actually walked back into the shop and let them know how good I thought it was and that hopefully they would truly consider putting it on the menu. The whole staff seemed genuinely thankful for my quick comment, and I really do hope to come back for more of the yummy snack. 

From what I understand this place is fairly new... In my opinion the staff and crew at Mr. Tea is doing everything right in order to keep us all happy. Its so nice when a business puts such strong effort into making the experience good for everyone. And my drink was very tasty and the light bulb cup just made it even more enjoyable.

I also like their frozen pizzas, and their frozen desserts.  

Trader Joe's has a variety of things that you would normally pay an arm and a leg for else where (organic veggies and a ton of nuts). BTW their nut selection is unlike any that I have ever seen in town, and it doesn't break the bank. 

I basically hit this place up at least every two weeks for my fresh flowers and coconut water.

1,"Osaka is my go to a-la-cart Japanese restaurant in Markham. They are always busy so wait times are usually expected. Their staff is very friendly and polite. Although the appetizers are delicious, the price point is pretty high for the amount of food they give. Their special maki rolls are decently priced and worth. All the rolls are amazing and the portion is enough for sharing. You can easily be full without even eating half of it. My favorites are the Salmon Lovers (spicy salmon topped with spicy salmon and tempura bits) and the Amazing Spider Roll which comes with an entire soft shell crab. The dinner bentos are pricier than most places. My favorite among the bento boxes would be the Kalbi- easily comes off the bones and very flavorful. They do however have lunch specials with the bentos. I would recommend trying bentos during lunch and  having rolls for dinner. The Don's come with a lot of vegetables and not a lot of what their feature was for so I would recommend getting rolls instead. The ramen/udon was okay but I would not come here for it.",0,0,1

I had the fresh shrimp and super-crunchy fried fish, and while both had their own sauce (Thai Sweet Chili and a cumin-laced mayo respectively), they both shared a fresh and light mix of cabbage, tomato, onion and carrot that had a nice crunch.  A lime wedge is provided for acidity, and half a dozen hot sauces are available. A side order of fries can be had for $2, but for lunch seemed somewhat superfluous and heavy in the stomach after eating these delightful $4 tacos.  Of course if you're into that, they still have the old standby of fish and chips, and fries can be decked out with varying forms of poutinification.

I don't tend to spicy things, but I understand that the jalapeno jelly was excellent.  A quick bit of spice with the sweetness of jelly.  We also tried the pork rolls which were crispy on the outside and tender and delicious on the inside.  The potato boats (or skins or whatever they call them), were well executed as well.
Since we were there for a few hours, we decided to order the chicken boxty, which was excellent as well.  The potato was cooked just right, the chicken was tender and juicy and the white sauce was to die for.  It also came with a side of steamed veggies that was well cooked (not mushy, not too crisp).

Aside from a lackluster ambiance, there are many reasons to enjoy Globefish--chiefly, the food and service is outstanding.

The host/owner was very warm and friendly. The frostyTiger beer from Singapore was even more friendly.
To start: Cold Sesamee Noodles with Peanut Sauce 3/5 Stars - too heavy on the peanut sauce - tasted almost like peanut butter - you really need to stir it up well before serving. Tastes better the second day when it's refrigerator cold.
Pan Fried Dumplings 4/5 Stars - really nice filling, the wrappers were a little thick and doughy for my tastes.
One of our waiters suggested the entrees we ended up ordering. Szechuan Beef - spicy, savory with a little sweet and sour - they added broccoli at no additional charge. Wan Fu Scallops - spiced and seared, served with vegetables. Both were really good but the beef was better, hands down; 4/5 Stars.

We ordered the 'Truffled Potato Chips, Maytag with Blue Cheese Sauce' and 'Wood Oven Pizza with Roasted Mushrooms, Broccolini, Leeks, Thyme and Taleggio.' The potato chips were something different than standard truffled potato chips. The blue cheese was bold enough to pair well with the truffle oil. All in all, making a complex tasting potato chip. Yummo! The pizza was great, although, I felt that the crust was tough and a little over cooked. The selection of toppings were unique for a vegetarian pizza and created a wonderful mesh of flavors.

4,"Went into this local eatery with about 10 friends on a Sunday afternoon for an impromptu lunch. The staff was very friendly and did their best to get us in & out quickly as we only had and hour before we had to head back to a conference. The waitress took our orders quickly, and brought our food out one at a time to speed things up. Everyone's food looked good- mostly standard bar fare such as burgers, hot dogs, grilled cheese, etc. 

The bar itself had a strong Midwestern theme, with Chicago, Wisconsin, and Minnesota sports memorabilia (see photos). Since we were there on a Sunday, they had football going on all of their TVs, so it looks like a great place to chill out and watch some sporting events. They also had an outdoor patio (with another TV) if the weather draws you outdoors.

2,"The Rose Tea Cafe is probably the most ""Chinese"" Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh, offering authentic food that most nearby delivery Chinese joints wouldn't even know how to cook.

What does that mean?  If you've grown up eating Chinese food from American restaurants, some of Rose Tea's more eclectic fare may take some getting used to and some of the standard dishes (you know, the Sesame Chicken, the General Tso's) may taste a bit different.

My advice?  Be adventurous.  Try something that sounds weird.  If you like it, yay!  Otherwise...uh...try something else next time.

The lunch specials (that cover the front of the menu) are an excellent deal - especially if you enjoy their egg and vegetables or order a bubble tea to go along with it - and the dishes aren't too weird.

The atmosphere of the place is also nice.  It's small and cozy, with the tables far enough apart that eating doesn't feel cramped.  It can get quite loud inside, but that just another way Rose Tea makes it feel like a little piece of Chinatown in Pittsburgh.",1,1,1

I had too many ideas and was probably more confused than ever. They were both able to help me narrow down my final selection by simply asking me a lot of questions about the style that I was looking for, the color palette and if I was more into simple designs or more complicated, or if I want it hints of color or very colorful wedding etc. They took the time to go over other designs that they've done for other wedding parties. In the end they were able to help me pick the flowers and design an arrangement to be exactly what I was looking for and stay within my budget. I have never heard so many people come up and ask me who did all the centerpieces and all the flowers and bouquets for the wedding.

There are so many reasons to list on why I chose this school over the 6 others I had toured as well.  The owner, Jill, is absolutely amazing at what she does.  I love that we have assemblies every Thursday.  Most of the time we have amazing guest speakers, and almost every week we are forced to think about of future and to prep for our career.  I love that one of the main focuses is ""becoming a better version of yourself.""  
      There are also other opportunities for you to get involved that they just don't offer at other schools.  (ie. student council, contests, Dream team, etc)  I also love that it is a private academy.  Which means, they do not accept everyone.  They have strict guidelines on attendance and GPA, which I can really appreciate.  This school holds it's students accountable and really prepares us to be professional and successful employees of the beauty industry.
     Our location is absolutely PERFECT.  Not to mention the school itself is absolutely beautiful!  When I'm there I feel like I'm in a professional salon.  I've toured some other schools and I must say this is the most professional, beautiful, and clean facility that I have seen.  
    Now to just touch base on the products we use.  I love Bumble and Bumble. The Esthetician's in training use skin medica and Dermalogica.  All amazing, top of the line products.  We learn Pivot Pointe International and I'm extremely comfortable in the way I have been taught.  
     I love that we have loyal guests that consistently return to our salon.

I wanted to give Indian food a proper go and wanted to go for an authentic food experience.

For starters wee ordered a Masala Dosa, Papadams and a couple rounds of Mango Lassi. The Dosa was DELICIOUS. I was addicted to the Papadams and the Mango Lassi makes my mouth water when I'm thinking about it.

For the main plates I went with the safe butter chicken plate and my cuz went with the goat vindaloo. Each plate comes with Naan bread, potatoes and rice.

I came to the realization I'm not fond of butter chicken but the sauce was perfectly fine. The naan bread was amazing. I also had a few bites of the goat vindaloo and it was a delight (minus the spicy!). Overall, I enjoyed my plate.

6,"Long overdue with this one. 

This review starts off poor but ends very well. 

The first person who assisted us was absolutely terrible. It was clear she didn't care about either her job or us.

What's worse is the situation was a sudden loss of vision - leaving an otherwise healthy person with all  their senses incapable of their regular routine.

You'd figure a little compassion might come into play, and as the job of this individual was the first point of contact with CNIB, she would care, right?

Wrong. No mention was made of either the programs or assistance offered to those in such a position. I'm not even sure what the point of getting a ride over a half hour away was. 

Example? The client expressed an interest in outdoor glasses which may help vision. The employee advised the client they sold them in their gift shop. The client purchased glasses. The client later learns this could have been covered by the government program - and instead was charged full price for the glasses. Hey, thanks a lot!!  Two more trips to the CNIB were required to resolve this. All of which could have been avoided if the employee had done her job. 

This employee was going on vacation so I guess didn't bother to put effort in, and in fact, her out-of-office auto responder was on since that morning though she was not off until noon. I guess she attends to the important things only. 

So why four stars after such a poor experience? 

The second person who assisted us - after complaints to the manager of the initial low vision specialist - was incredible. 

She went out of her way to really and truly help. Above and beyond, really. 

Went through the programs and services and made sure to cover them, even though we may not make use of them. Provided a donated magnifying glass to boot. 

I guess as with all things in life when you're dealing with others, if the person believes in what they do, you're lucky. If not, you may be left to fend for yourself. Not an easy thing if you've just lost one of the senses we tend to take for granted every day. 

Finally, the gentlemen in the CNIB store were excellent. Helpful and knowledgeable as well as accommodating.",1,7,1

They told us that they could not operate on her, nor could they manage her pain overnight. I put in a desperate call to Italian Greyhound Rescue and they reminded me that Alta Vista (right in my neighborhood) had extended hours. 

I was so concerned about getting her the best care. The front desk team and owner of the clinic greeted us and put us at ease right away. The vet technicians were very gentle and compassionate to her. We knew that they truly felt for how serious the situation was. I was a very complicated break and she would need a very good orthopedic surgeon. The doctor that read the X-rays to us explained everything in great detail. They helped us decide on the best options to keep her comfortable and calm overnight until we could find a surgeon. They even allowed my husband to go home and get her bed and blanket so she could feel less afraid. 

Because she only weighs 6 pounds, we had some concerns over how much and what type of pain relief she would receive and again all of our concerns were addressed with lots of details to keep us informed. They even gave us a number to call into overnight to check on her well being.

In the morning when we went  to pick her up, she was alert and pain free. The team at Alta Vista kept the port for her IV in her other leg and even sent her pain management drip bag with her so that they would not have to poke her again at the surgeons office and we would not have to pay for another bag. 

In a hectic and emotionally draining situation, the team at Alta Vista was a comforting, caring resource. We feel we got the best veterinary care in our Phoenix neighborhood at a very fair price for our treasured pet. Thank you so much guys!",0,0,1

3,"So on our 2nd night in Vegas, we go to our car and notice it was lopsided. Upon closer look, we see our front tire, that we filled with air at a gas station the day before, was flat. After getting horribly dirty changing the tire, we slept then found a tire place the next day. 
We called discount tire and spoke to Raul and he told us we could come right in. We got there and Raul greeted us with a smile and helped us right away. He told us the valve stem was messed up and that he would fix it for free. FREE?! We thought we were hearing things, but no that is what he said. On top of that, they have free coffee and bottled water. In and out in about 15 minutes with no monetary exchange.  For his help we were willing to pay much more than that.  He even told us how we should be getting new tires soon and recommended another brand of our same type of tires that are cheaper than the ones we use. 
We will definitely go to their other locations with that kind of service",0,0,1

35,"For my birthday weekend, I simply could not refuse an all inclusive triple threat package offered by the esteemed Wynn resort, which included complimentary tickets to Le Reve, room upgrades at the hipper and edgier Encore suites, VIP access to XS and free buffet! I know, It was pretty much a no-brainer in my book.  

Upon arrival at the Encore, parking was a breeze! Complimentary valet had me out of my car and in the registration line in a snap! Speaking of registration, I was convinced to ""upgrade"" my existing upgrade to a 60th floor panoramic suite. I know, I'm weak, but i'm glad I gave in! The upgraded room was magnificent! It came with an expansive living space with two plush queen beds, large bath with shower and separate soaking tub and outstanding views of the Las Vegas strip!  And who can forget about the remote controlled curtains and bathroom TV ;)  Tack on top of that premium gaming options, the exquisite resort grounds, and exceptional dining options, which include sumptuous tapas at La Cave and spectacular brunch fare at Tableau, and you've got yourself one happy birthday boy!   VIP access to the hottest clubs on the strip like XS and Surrender and premium shopping at premier boutiques like Hermés, Chopard & Louis Vuitton doesn't hurt either.  If golfing is your thing, Steve Wynn's got the largest 18 hole golf course on the Strip!  

Honestly, I practically spent my entire weekend here and rarely felt the need to ever leave the grounds. Now that's not an easy feat for any resort given all the tempting hotel and entertainment options out there!

1,"I would give this place 3.5 stars but I am rounding up to off-set Alice T.'s review. I was surprised to see this had such a low rating on yelp, but then realized there are only 2 reviews. I am puzzled that Alice T's review was included (despite the fact she only has 1 review) whereas reviews that sound pretty ""real"" from Yelpers were over 25 reviews were excluded... Anyways, I read Alice's review and felt some of the points were valid (no in-house plates) but I think a 1 star is harsh. Whether or not you agree with a grab & go model is not an assessment of a place's food. Anyways, the owner responded in a totally professional way on Yelp which is good. 

So yes, this is a welcome addition to the area, which does not have a whole lot of great, fast lunch options that are healthy. I have tried some of their salads and find them to be fresh and flavourful, although I could make something very similar at home, it is the convenience you are paying for. It's cute that some of the salads are named after various Toronto neighbourhoods. I think my favourite is the Kensington Mexican salad with lots of avocado and corn. Yum! They also have some hot entrees like grilled chicken, salmon, etc. with veggie sides. It could work well for grabbing dinner on the way home, or a heartier lunch. They also carry a small selection of grocery type items (e.g. De Cecco pastas, boxes of tea). It's not cheap, but prices are reasonable. I also like that there are small snack sized salads along with bigger ones. I've never tried their breakfast sandwiches but they sound delicious!

When I've been, the service is always welcoming and friendly. I even saw the chef today singing some Motown as he moved between the back kitchen and the front area -- nice to see people who enjoy what they are doing:) 

Seating is limited, although I walk by frequently on weekdays and it's never packed. So you should be able to sit there if you choose. As mentioned, it is more of a grab & go place, which is fine by me. I usually pick something up and bring it back to my office, where co-workers enviously ask where I got my lunch!",0,0,1

Although, there are a ton of fabulous restaurants in Toronto but you really can't beat the food in the market. In any case, the rooms, yes, they're clean, have wonderful hardwood floors.

2,"After looking through many reviews of nail salons in the area of town that I was going to be in, I choose More Then Nails. The majority of the comments were good and the prices stated seemed reasonable. I made an appointment and they got to work right away. Of course doing pedi first. It was great! I love when they actually take longer then a second to massage my feet and calfs. I did have to tell her not to use the mircoplane. Aka cheese grater. But that didn't turn me off as most places still use this practice. On to my nails, I'm super picky about my nails which is one reason why I quit getting them, the other they tear up your nails like nobody's business. But as I've hit a milestone birthday my nails have began to peel with no help from anything else I decided if they're going to peel and look bad then I guess I'll get them done. So in my choosing I looked at the pictures carefully. I like them shortish and straight, on all sides and I don't like the acrylic to be applied thick. I specified these things before she started. I asked for the glitter acrylic on the tips and the base clear. I know I know, I don't know the process and steps involved but I didn't want to get too far in and she'd have to redo something so maybe I spoke up to much. She wouldn't cut them as short as I would have liked them to be. Some look like the flared duck goose whatever the popular thing is these day (I hate them BTW) and some are not filed even on the tips and some are still a tad too thick. I was in there for two hours and had an appointment following or else I might have been more specific on the corrections. Now to pay, I had my 10% off yelp check in, it saved me $8. Yep, the way I broke it down in my head was $50 for a set, ok so I get the glitter acrylic was probably extra so $55. Which leaves me with a $25 pedicure. But if I compare the picture of the girl that paid $50 for duck nails and rhinestones on four fingers how does that make sense? Anyhow, I'm a good tipper but I did not leave on the original amount. In the end my nails and my feet are nice and I do love the pink glitter tips. I would return for a second chance to see if they are more accepting to how I like them to look in the end. Overall the visit was nice. The place is clean and organized. Free wifi and movies playing that you can actually see without straining your neck to watch. Ok I'm giving them five stars because I have yet to meet a nail salon to do at least that.",2,1,1

4,"OMG! After almost 4 years of looking like an old lady with a bad ""do"", I am now pleased to say my hair is looking great.. (sadly I'm still old though)...

I relocated from Chicago and have had some bad haircuts in the last 4 years. I really never knew exactly how bad I could look till I moved here.. yikes.. From one side of the city to the other, I booked appointments and cried over the results..

I had the read the great reviews of The Root Salon about 6 mos ago, but I continued to think positive about my stylist and didn't give up till I just couldn't walk around with that cut anymore... 

So today I braved the outside world (without a bag over my scary hair), and drove over to my first appointment for a cut with Dana.. I was pretty nervous as just when I think it can't get worse.. it usually DID, but not TODAY!!!

After he patiently listened to my whining, studied my 50+ pics of ""my before I moved to Phoenix cuts""... he figured out a plan to get my hair back on track. And yes, it's a work in progress.. it needs some time to grow, but there is a game plan.. and I'm so excited!

And even after just a tiny trim, I look so much better.. not YOUNGER, just better.. both my hair and my attitude.. I'm smiling again..

The salon was beautiful, bright, clean and airy. The people were friendly and despite how I looked, complimented me, offered me refreshments and made me feel welcome, like I was among friends. 

I am totally happy with The Root Salon and Dana is the best. I am finally on my way to feeling good about my hair, now I just need better wrinkle cream to go with my new look...

I am a happy customer.. and can't wait to be back in 6 weeks.

We went on a recent weeknight and each ordered a half chicken with two sides to give us dinner and lunch for the next day. The employee who we placed our order with was super friendly and helpful. He recommended that I order their most popular sides: garlic potatoes and squash casserole. My husband ordered rice and collards.

The food came out pretty quick and was fresh. The chicken was aaaaaaamazing. Fall off of the bone delicious! I loved the garlic potatoes and the little corn bread muffin. While the squash casserole may be popular, I wasn't a fan of it. It tasted more like cornbread stuffing with a little bit of squash in it. My husband wasn't overly wowed by the rice or collards.

The wife and I went around 8:00pm on a Sunday night and it was empty. Literally. Not a soul in there. It was a bit weird at first, but within 5 mins another couple came in as well. But that was it.

The interior and atmosphere of the place was perfect, nice and cozy, great for a date night, and it smelled amazing as soon as you walked in.

We ordered the Elk Shikari and the Chicken Biryani, and shared them between the 2 of us.

Notes:

1)Flavors were amazing. Subtle spices, nothing overpowering, but the more you ate, the more you realized how bang on everything was. Just amazing food.

2)Huge portions. Good christ. We polished off the Elk but had to get most of the Biryani to go, we were so stuff. Honestly if you got an app to start, those two dishes could easily feed 4 people.

3)It was a bit pricey, but the portions are so big and the food so flavorfull, it's worth it to treat yourself.

4)The wine menu was pretty lacking, I'm not a big fan of VQA wines, which is all they have. I had the Shiraz which was better than I thought it would be but I would have liked more selection, especially for that price.

5)The staff were very nice, but kind of slow, especially considering there were so few people in there.

2,"Ok I've been eating Italian, real Italian, all my life with my friends and family through New York and New England and even in Italy and I am blown away by the authenticity and quality of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New Years Eve 2014. It's not really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out type strip mall joint. DON""T BE FOOLED by the unassuming street front. Go inside and check it out!! I literally stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. While taking in the inviting, Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile to let me know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly be back to. I didn't see the wine list but it appears you'll most definitely be able to find something you like - I saw lots of good opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out by the staff that looked really nice. The bar keep thanked me, wished me Happy New Year and off I went.
I ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely amazing!
The pasta was cooked perfectly - great texture and flavor. The gravy was bright red and full of fresh tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. The salad was certainly a masterpiece. Chopped is certainly the right name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!
Needless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu.

First of all, they are prompt. I walked-in on a weekday around 3:30pm and they immediately greeted me and asked what I wanted done. Although they had about 3-4 clients I did not have to wait. Which was great! They have several nail techs! 

Secondly, my nail tech, Hannah, was so sweet and super attentive. She offered me wine (which was delicious), but what I loved most about this nail tech was that she took her time. She was very thorough.  It seemed that way with the other techs too. I can not stand when nail techs are trying to rush you out.

Also, price is fair, very similar to other places, except this places offers you something to drink which is nice! The salon isn't really fancy or anything but the quality is great. They have a great selection of nail colors and gel polish (which is what I got).

That's right, even before you enter the place, a Steam Whistle employee give you coupons good for two 'tasters' which are actually two decent (but not pints) sized cups of their Pilsner. Right off that bat, I love this place! There's no food because according to Canadfan law of some kind if you want to serve food at a brewpub, you have to offer more than one choice of brew. And as I mention, Steam Whistle only does one and they're not changing that. So no food but no money to spend either unless you want some of their swag. The tour and the beer is free! I think they sometimes hold free concerts too. So why spend money on overpriced Molson, Rickards or Labatt at the Sports Venues? Just come here before or after the game.",0,1,1

3,"A very nicely rum operation.  Have been here a number of times with grandchildren, who really like this as an excursion, especially on rainy days.

Clean and well-organized, A. D. is the floor manager and is totally on-top of the operation.  People enter and shop for the already cleaned and bisque fired pieces.  Prices vary from a few dollars to over $30.  Very extensive selection to choose from.

Then your group sits at one of the many tables to ""paint"" or glaze your pieces.  There are squeeze bottles of glazes to choose from.  Samples of each glaze are displayed for each, so pick your palette.

Brushes, a dish of water and small tiles are at each table so that you can squirt a dollop of glaze on to the tile and use your brush to apply each glaze to your piece.  This is totally self-serve and easy to figure out.  Even young ones around 5 years old do quite well.

Bring your finished pieces to the front desk to be listed and described and to then pay for your play.  In addition to the bisque pieces there is a $6 per person charge for each hour you spend in the shop.  Maximum is $12.  A week to ten days later you can pick up your fired pieces.

It is wonderful that you do not have to clean up your area.  A.D. and her crew do it for you.  Nice.

There are toddler days and you can book parties.  Contact A.D. to find out details.  

They are organized, focused on making people happy and the place is neat as a pin.  Good job, A.D.",1,1,1

1,"I used to be too scared to climb this mountain. Lately, I've toughened up and now I love it! It's difficult and I'd recommend shoes with good tread and lots of water and a few snacks- fruit or granola bars, because it can be intense. Some people make it up and down with no problem, but people do get hurt here so be careful. Bring your cell phone in case of emergency. There are two sides to this mountain. The more difficult trail is called Echo Canyon. I have also hiked on the Cholla Trail and it's somewhat different. I would say it's less difficult, but still no walk in the park. The higher you get on the trail, the more steep spots you might encounter. Make sure you have good tred on your shoes to avoid falling. Definitely make sure you bring enough water to get yourself through the hike and maybe some extra in case you see a hiker in distress. It's also easy for your pet to get dehydrated so if you bring your dog, give them lots of water breaks and stop in shady spots to recoup your energy. Have fun, but be smart about it! Nature is wild!",2,1,1
1,"When I first looked at the menu, I thought the prices seemed a little high.  After getting and eating our food, I decided the prices were great.  The food was delicious and the portions were huge.

I order the chicken fried steak with 2 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and biscuits.  The steak was huge and was covered in sausage gravy; not just plain white gravy.  The hashbrown order was big.  The two biscuits were small and a little dry but came with plenty of butter and strawberry jam.  There were supposed to be two eggs but I would guess that I actually got four.  

My wife got the chicken tenders.  She could not finish the french fries and could only eat half of the tenders. 

Everything was delicious.  Except for the hashbrowns.  I ordered them extra crispy but they were just barely brown.  The cook did not use enough oil on the grill so the had sploches of brown with mostly pale, undercooked potato on the surface.  The server offered to have them re-done but that is never a good idea.

Speaking of the server, she was excellent.

Overall, an excellent meal.  I highly recommend them.  Just don't order the hashbrowns.",0,0,1

While on vacation in Vegas, I often dine here when I am staying at the Wynn properties hotel. At my most recent stay I came here for breakfast. Didn't order anything complicated, a iced vanilla latte to start. And my breakfast was 3 eggs with potatoes, bacon and some toast on the side. As simple and basic as my meal was, it was absolutely delicious because everything was done so well. Probably the best iced vanilla latte I have ever had. The quality off the eggs were organic and were perfectly cooked sunny side up. The bacon I asked to be cooked crispy, and it was. Hot and crispy which is so rare when you go to so many breakfast places. The potatoes were great too, mixed variety of sweet and regular. And great bread offered with delicious jams and spreads.

2,"I got a Groupon based on the good Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed. I would call them to get a quote before buying a deal next time, just to be sure. 
Eric's wife was very kind and informative when I called to schedule the cleaning, and Eric arrived within the window I had been given. He recommended a pretreat which was an extra $30 I think, but I'd known that going in so I wasn't surprised. It took less than an hour, I think, for our three bedroom house (including hall and living room). There are a few areas where the wear on the carpet still looks a little dingy, but I'm willing to believe that is wear and not dirt. The carpets really look great. 
The only difficulty was that while Eric said the carpets would take 4-8 hours to dry, and it was about 70 that day and we had the ceiling fans on in every room and the windows open (so I was SURE we'd be fine), the carpet where my daughter's mattress lays straight on the floor was still a little damp at the 8 hour mark (which was also her bedtime). I fudged it by laying beach towels down under the mattress so she could go to sleep, then propped the mattress back up again the next morning. 
I will certainly call up Wardlow's for all future carpet cleaning, but I think I'll try to schedule it for the summer (or wait until we've transitioned to a bunk bed so the bed isn't against the carpet).",0,1,1

I spotted a few other nasal sprays and allergy pills in the health and beauty department.  

I've missed watching indie films at the now-closed Camelview 5 theater, since tickets cost only $9 there (students and seniors could access into additional savings).

6,"-- My First Impression ---

I found this food truck on Instagram. I thought it was pretty cool to have soft-served ice-cream inside a donut cone. After finding out that yesterday was the first day they launched the chimney cone with ice-cream, I knew I had to give it a try. The lineup was very long, it took us 50 minutes in the line to wait to order and another 35 minutes to pick up our cones. However, you won't get bored during the wait since the food truck was inside the Evergreen Brick Works and they were hosting an Etsy market there. We shopped around when we were waiting to pick up our chimney cones. 

-- Food & Drink --

We ordered 2 items:

1. Dream Cone (aka the Ultimate) -- Nutella coated on the interior of the baked Hungarian pastry. Butter toffee bits and salted caramel brownie were layered on top of the vanilla soft serve cone. 

2. Eva's Apple Pie -- Similar to the dream cone, the Hungarian pastry was covered with cane sugar and cinnamon, the interior was filled with homemade apple preserves and topped with vanilla soft serve ice-cream. They put a chocolate truffle in the bottom of the cone to prevent the sauce from leaking out of the cone, which was pretty smart. 

I found both cones are very delicious. Personally I like the Eva's Apple Pie more because cinnamon sugar simply complements the apple sauce better. The apple sauce was very tangy and wasn't too sweet. I found the cones very big and they were perfect for sharing. 

-- Overall --

Even though it took us a long time to wait for the chimney cones, they taste heavenly good and I would definitely go back to revisit them. The food truck owner gave everyone a gift, a free chimney cone for our next purchase, for being supportive on their launch day. I can't wait to go back this summer to try other flavors. :)",1,2,1

Likewise, avoid the Sweet Tea if you're diabetic, or ask them to cut it half-n-half with the regular tea because DAMN is it sweet.

If you're in the Phoenix location, you may have this sneaking suspicion that you'll come out to find your car up on blocks, but I've never had any trouble and if it's that much of a concern to you, the Scottsdale location is all nice and pretty.

Four stars only because the chicken has been a bit skin/batter-heavy and in a way that hasn't been amazing the last couple of times I've gone. When all's said and done though, you can't beat the combo.

Our first meal in Quebec turned out to be the best one we had our entire week in Montreal and Quebec City.  Not only that, it may be the best meal I've ever heard.

The combinations of flavors of the pintxos were unbelievable as was the freshness of the vegetables.   The cod was spectacular and the grape tomatoes served with it were the sweetest I've ever tasted.   The wine pairing suggested by our waiter was perfect.

Not only is her studio inviting and relaxing, but she sincerely takes the utmost interest in your skin, what has improved, remembers little add ons that you may enjoy during your session and gives suggestions as to anything that can help with any concerns you have. Her upbeat vibe and natural products make the experience. Unfortunately, I do not get to go monthly for facials due to time, but feel 1000 times better each time I can. She also is a rockstar at Microblading, and takes her time as she is truly a perfectionist. I highly recommend Amber and her studio deserve way more than a 5 star rating!!",0,1,1

3,"Absolutely amazing!!! My MOH said it right- ""a whirlwind of fabulous!"" These guys have makeup and hair down to a science. They came to my hotel on time and I have never seen anyone work that fast. Hair and makeup was done in about 25 minutes. It definitely didn't feel rushed, though- these guys are just that good. James did my hair and makeup. I showed him a picture of hair I wanted and he delivered it exactly. I went with air brush makeup and added lashes and told him I wanted a more natural look- basically a better version of myself. He did exactly that and my makeup stayed fresh until 1am that night!! (They came over at 11am!). I got a ton of compliments. They are worth every penny. They are fun to chat with too. Fun fact- on a slow day they see 30 brides!!!! On busy days close to 60. That goes to show how fast and efficient these guys are. I was so impressed. Thanks for making me feel beautiful on my special day!",0,1,1

The store itself is huge, and has a ton of in house services.  They have a seamstress with a dry cleaners, a coldstone creamery, starbucks and a bunch of other stuff here too.  Full wine section, sushi bar, kosher section, electronics, FULL deli, and so much more.

I love the full service stores because it makes grocery shopping fun.  TONS of selection, prepared foods, and so many options.  It dwarfs ""normal"" non signature stores because its got a ton more stuff.  I find that I am more productive with my grocery shopping here because after seeing everything they have, I get better ideas of what to make, cook and do at home.

Come shopping here just once, and you will see just how awesome this place is.",1,2,1
6,"This location is pretty small only about 8 tables and a bar with stools. You order at the register then grab a table so you may have a wait. The line for the register was long but it went quick. 

I had the AvocaToast which was good BUT if you like home cooking comfort food the Steak Eyes is phenomenal!! The gravy was FanFreakingTastic! 

My only complaint would be our friend ordered the Super Berry protein waffles and there was mold in it from the berries. We let them know they fired a new dish but the new had moldy berries as well. Luckily she's not allergic but 2x's is not cool. 

I will for sure be back but ordering from the happy side of the menu next time :)",2,3,1

5,"We were attending a concert at the Golden Nugget last weekend and wanted to stay downtown instead of ubering back and forth. There are some hotels downtown I will never stay at, but of the ones I will, the Golden Nugget and Downtown Grand are the best. Of those two options, Downtown Grand happened to be $10 cheaper. 

The hotel stands out for being modern but not in a trying-too-hard way. It's also not full of cigarette smoke and people that look like they've been playing slots for 24 hours straight. Check in was easy, and we were informed there was a pool party happening that night, but we didn't attend. We were also informed that we would get free wifi and bottles of water. This surprised me as everyone knows most hotels in Vegas will stick a mini Fiji water in your room and charge $10 if you open it. Well, same sort of concept because when I was signing my bill I found out that the bottles of water, wifi, and fitness room were part of a $23 or so ""experience fee."" I assume this is similar to the popular resort fees on the strip, except I guess the Downtown Grand isn't exactly a resort. We didn't use the wifi or fitness room (so small) but did drink some of the bottled water, which was not very good. So basically whatever price you see advertised, add on another $20 plus tax to stay here. 

We had to walk across a skybridge to our tower, but it's not a long walk and the view is nice. Unfortunately we weren't able to take our elevator to the ground floor which was the street level so any time we had to return or leave our hotel we had to go through the main lobby. The rooms are very nice, and we had a corner room overlooking Sunrise Mountain which I love. We also happened to be able to see the pool which was cool, though we could hear the music from our room. It didn't matter because we were going out anyways. 

We debated going to the pool in the morning but skipped it. Overall I like the location of the Downtown Grand: close to Pizza Rock, Gold Spike, Hogs and Heifers, and Nacho Daddy. It took about 5 min. to walk to the Golden Nugget for our show. It's a whole lot better than staying on Fremont where the music never ends outside. If you want to stay in a nice hotel downtown and not be in the middle of all the craziness I would highly recommend the Downtown Grand.",2,2,1
5,"Since my first visit here, over a year ago, I have returned twice.  This is not a place I can afford to go to every day, but I really can't wait to go back. It has become my favorite dining experience in Cleveland.  Why?
I really like the use of local, seasonal meat and produce.  I really like the changing menu, with a few items that change, while most vary.  I like the variety of menu items and styles.  I like the vegan and vegetarian options.  I like the generous pours from the bar.  I like the friendly, attentive service.  I like that this is a high end dining experience that you can go to dressed casual and act casual.  It is not ostentatious.  It is fun.
I suggest you get the four course deal for $44, saving one course for dessert.  The devils on horseback are great, but the seasonal salads do no disappoint, either.  If you are adventurous, try the fifth quarter, which is their daily appetizer special.  Usually creative and amazing.  They have the unusual pig's head (yes, half of an intact pig's head) and Fred Flintsone short rib.  Both of these are pricey, but meant to be shared.  Their oxtail risotto is amazing - tastes better than it looks or sound.  Their daily specials are great.  I am not a person who likes their fish cooked with the skin on, but they have converted me.  If you are not adventurous, you can order a burger and fries.  Be prepared for a generous portion of meat on a flavorful bun done to your specification.  If you have a large group, order the bread board.  It is worth it for the variety of breads and spreads you will receive.
Then there is dessert.  The buttered popcorn pot de creme is as addicting as any illegal drug.  You can't stop eating it.  Other items are just as great.  Their pressed coffee and fresh tea help to complete your dining experience.
So if you are looking for a steakhouse, don't come here.  If you are looking just for a burger and fries, you probably will be left wondering what the hype is all about.  If you are looking for mainstream comfort food, this is not the place to go.  If you are looking for a unique dining experience, with great service and well prepared food in a casual environment, this is your place.
I cannot rave enough about this place.  I am looking forward to returning, perhaps to try the rooftop dining during the summer.",2,2,1
2,Yardbird brings the south to the west!!! The fried chicken and waffles are my Number 1 recommendation which I'm sure you constantly see as a review lol.

Lol great move on my part lol  So while in Vegas do not miss out on checking them out! I suggest a reservation though!,0,1,1
0,"This is a fun place to go to experience something totally different.  And yes everything is made out of ice, including the glasses you drink out of.  If you get cold easily, this is not the place for you unless you want to spend $25 and spend less than 5 minutes in there while downing your drink.
The $25 comes with a parka, gloves, and one drink.  I think it is worth it simply for the experience, especially if you have never been in an ice bar before.  For $35 you get all of the above plus one more drink.  You can buy drinks inside the bar, but they are more expensive if bought inside than prepaying for outside.  You can stay as long as you want inside the bar, and are also allowed in and out privileges.  They don't allow cameras or phones in there because ""the temperature difference between the ice bar and the outside temperature causes camera lenses to break.""  I don't doubt that is true, SOMETIMES, but I am guessing they just say that so you can't take pictures inside which cost $20 for the first picture and $10 for each additional.  (They do provide a locker to put your electronics and no additional cost.)  There is a photographer that takes pictures of everyone and was very pleasant.  The bar tenders weren't very friendly, but I wouldn't be either if I stayed in 5 degree temperature for hours on end.
The place itself is extremely small and was probably about 2/3's the size of my normal hotel room at The Mandalay Bay.",0,0,1

Dave answered my many questions about my car and made sure to give me a fair price. He went outside and showed me exactly what was going on with my tires and explained it all clearly and professionally. This was such a comfort to me. Despite being very busy he took the time to figure out what worked for my car, my driving needs, and my budget. He is a true expert!

Their tapioca is a little too chewy for my preferences, but their matcha flavour has really grown on me. It's subtle, but present. There are no artificial flavors that linger in my mouth and it's overall a very refreshing drink.

I did, however, try the food here today for the first time. They serve a selection of Taiwanese-based dishes so I ordered the noodles with ground beef. It had a rather.. unusual savoury taste to it, which I was reluctant to at first, but it was redeemed by the fact that it was steaming hot when served to me. Whatever sauce they used in this dish was nothing like the ones I've had before, which were all more pungent and vinegary, not to mention a lot redder in color. The portion size was fair and the price was just at the upper range of what I would consider reasonable for what it's worth at this location. Would I order this again though? Nah. 

Though the food didn't impress me, I'll still frequent Jule because of its comforting atmosphere and wonderful accommodations.. and probably just stick with the drinks next time! (Not that I have a choice anyway since there's a minimum sitting fee)",0,2,1

1,"my girlfriend & i loved our dinner at FnB. duck breast entree with chorizo, a slightly crunchy textured saffron rice & black olive tapenade was beautifully prepared --an almost perfectly balanced dish. while not as spectac the pasta with lobster mushrooms & peas definitely qualified as delicious home-style comfort food. green salad with fennel / cucumber / feta & grilled shishito pepper appetizers were both gold star, smashed cucumbers tasted a little under-dressed to us. all three appetizers were wonderfully fresh. grilled okra with labna yogurt & hazelnuts was right up there among the best vegetable dishes i've had in years. we seldom get desert, at FnB we ordered two, & both the labna ice cream & buttered corn bread with plums & vanilla ice cream killed it. we were initially taken aback that the only by-the-glass wines are from arizona vintners but the two reds recommended by the waiter worked out well. bottle list is eclectic in the best way, heavy on gamay & pino, two cabs only both from lebanon... service was informed, enthusiastic & articulate.

The Lantern/Sake Bottle shrine right at the entrance is very representative of an IZAKAYA and others should take note but understanding it's downtown most other places rather have seating space rather than decor.

We were greeted by a gentlemen in full Japanese Chef GEAR and was very friendly but noticeably Korean.  This will later on be a beneficial as you read on...

Takowasabi($3.99) was delicious with raw Octopus bits and that recognizable Wasabi KICK.  There were some dried Blueberries scattered on the side.

Takoyaki($4.99/7) was lacking as it was GOLDEN brown meaning it was deep fried.  Katsuobushi was almost nonexistent and the Mayo made the appearance very sloppy.  I would give this place 3.5 *Stars*.

Caught the show  at the Shimmer  Room in LVH  3/24 & this 71 year old was blown away along with the rest of the audience comprised of teens thru adults of all ages. Their mix of  rock, pop, R & B combined with their ingratiating individual personalities  made for an unbelievably entertaining family show. You would swear there's a band accompanying them, but as in one of the poster testimonials, you'll be surprised what comes out of their mouths. They are true showmen & deserve every accolade.

6,"I love Cartel. The coffee is awesome and the employees are almost always friendly. Do they have their bad days? Sure, but so does everyone.

I've noticed that most of the people complaining or leaving negative (or less positive) reviews are doing so because of the clientele. How immature. Let's stick to reviewing the venue and the product, not whether you like the patrons. If some patron doesn't like a frappuccino and says so to the barista, who really gives two flying pigs? Everyone is entitled to their opinion. My recommendation is to try to be a little less insecure and consider the impact your review will have on the actual business and the people that put their blood, sweat and tears into it, before you start taking away points because a certain part of society seeks out novelty and enjoys well made things. 

Just my two cents.",1,0,1

How does Hash House a Go Go exist? Even if you're drunker than a 19th century prospector, it's still easy to feel bad about stuffing your face with the food that's served in this restaurant. Forget reading Dante's Inferno; this place is like living the third circle of Hell. Everything is perpetually slathered in gelatinous gravy, propped up by creaking pillars of bacon, or slathered with butter and pancake syrup.

1,"I am shocked by the amount of poor reviews of this place. I have been coming here for a couple of months now and it is my go-to Vietnamese restaurant. The atmosphere is classic of a newly owned family run restaurant. They serve dishes such as Bun Mung Vit (Duck Noodle Soup) and Banh Canh (Tapioca Noodles) which are very niche dishes not found at many other restaurants. I have grown up around Vietnamese restaurants, Vietnamese food and the culture. I recently backpacked Southeast Asia and I can assure you that Pha Le's flavours and preparations are authentic and delicious. 

For those rating the service poorly, Yes, the owner speaks little to no English but he is trying his best and just wants to serve delicious Vietnamese food. I personally have never had a bad experience and the owner actually goes out of his way to constantly ask us if everything is okay which isn't the norm at most Vietnamese restaurants.

I started coming here when the menus were just one page and a lot of items had to be asked for. Yes their furniture is outdated but the restaurant is always clean and tidy. I hope their business continues to do well and they are able to upgrade their furniture.

I am lucky that I live in a location where I have a multitude of options (Lux, Lola, Hob Nobs, SBUX, etc) but I have to say I really liked the vibe here. The music wasn't loud, the people relatively quiet and chill, and I could actually focus on what I was doing without getting too distracted by everything around me. I liked that while on a busy street (7th Ave), the entrance and windows actually face the side street it is on. That added to the peace and quiet of it.

The decor is cool, it seems to be in an old stone house with a pointed roof which you would never guess from the outside. 

The only drawback, and it's a big one if you're in a hurry, it Paramount's popularity. It's always packed and you can expect at least a 30min wait for a table if you go right at lunchtime. The poor servers, while they do their best, are running around like crazy trying to keep up with the demand.

8,"BOTTOM LINE: There are enough good things about Mon Ami Gabi to deserve a four star review based on our dinner there last week. With so many restaurants in Las Vegas on the Strip, this is not one we'd necessarily seek out again unless it was a matter of convenience and timing that led us there.  But the outdoor patio seating provides a great opportunity for people watching and seeing the Bellagio fountain both, the food is good and the prices reasonable by Las Vegas standards.  So we're glad we went and can easily recommend it.

SEATING: We were a group of ten and we wanted an outdoor table so some of the folks involved  who had not been to Las Vegas before could watch the Bellagio fountains, right across the street, as they had dinner. 

Reservations are not taken for outdoor seating, and it was impressive that they could cobble together a table for ten with only about a 30 minute wait at 6:30. But what we learned from this is that Mon Ami Gabi's outdoor patio seating is probably best for couples or groups up to six just for the logistics of putting tables together. 

SERVICE: The restaurant was hopping inside and out and yet service was efficient for taking the orders and getting the food to the right diners and served at the right temperature. Not particularly friendly, but efficient worked in this case. 

FOOD: For a Las Vegas restaurant the range of choices, all with a French bistro bent, was impressive and the prices seemed more reasonable than other comparable places on the Strip. 

As example, a duck confit small plate that included a good dried cherry garnish was only about $11 and plenty for an entree for a light eater. Same with the crab cake served with a small slaw type salad for about $15. Same for the Caesar salad that was about $10. Steaks (served with pommes frites) for roughly $25.00 each. Scallop entree was about $30. And so on. Meals included some really good, crusty baguette set in the middle of the table in paper bags at the start. 

VALUE:  Total bill for ten, excluding cocktails but including a couple of beers, a couple of coffees and a soft drink,  was about $230.  A bargain by Strip standards. 

LIBATIONS: While we waited on our table, some of us adjourned to the (tiny) indoor bar for a cocktail. My hubby said his Maker's mint julep was very good and my Sidecar was one of the best I've had. Cousins in law had good things to say about their rum and cokes and whiskey and sodas. Cousin in law who picked up the tab said they were spendy. As I recall, five cocktails topped $60. 

AMBIANCE: The outdoor patio can be fun, for the reasons named in the start of this review. The indoor portion of the restaurant is actually quite large and seating in some of it offers a white tablecloth, cozy bistro ambiance. But, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is NOT the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners. So we'd recommend avoiding this section of the restaurant.

RESERVATION NOTE:  If you make a reservation (indoor seating only) you will need to provide a credit card.  Two hour in advance cancellation is required or your credit card will be charged $50 per head of the reservation. (Example, for a reservation for six people the default charge is $300.)  This isn't the only restaurant in Las Vegas to employ a similar tactic (Mesa as example does something similar).  But may be helpful to know this in advance.",3,3,1

The service was also great. The waitresses are all very attentive, and the manager was very accommodating to requests. Overall, a great experience.

The prices are a touch higher than other sushi places, especially if you're going on all out on the sashimi.

Make sure the to reserve a table for Friday or Saturday night. The restaurant is tiny, so they're generally full for dinner.",0,0,1

2,"Simply the best shoe store in Pittsburgh.  

They have the best selection I've come across and it really seems like they take pride in carrying quality shoes.

By far the best part about the store is the sales people.  They're extremely helpful, and really know their stuff.  When I was looking for a new pair of boots this winter I tried a few different places.  Sales associates at most places are content to grab you a pair of shoes and walk away, but here they're attentive and can actually tell you about the product (and they're not the least bit pushy).

It's the kind of place where they'll remember you, and Alberto's comment is spot on: They want to make sure you're happy months after your purchase.  You really don't get service like this anywhere else.  Ask for David.  Terrific guy.",0,0,1

1,"This cozy restaurant is located in Distillery District. Perfect for if you ever want to explore the area, have a romantic walk and take cute photos. The moment I walked inside, I felt a very Christmas-y vibe. The lighting was dimmed and it just felt so warm because there was so many chattering and laughter in the background. We didn't make a reservation so we did have to wait for a while, there were just so many people in line!!! I must say that my chair was very uncomfortable, it was one of those cold metal chairs where my bag and jacket kept falling off. Aside from that, the evening was perfect. My boyfriend requested that we come here for his birthday because he's been here before and said he's always wanted to take me here. He usually doesn't have a preference in where or what we eat, but he kept insisting that I try the Lobster Pappardelle.


Let me just say, the Lobster Pappardelle consisted of fresh lobster, wild mushroom, and black truffle cream sauce and it was bomb dot com. It was delicious. I'm not that big of a pasta/carb type of girl, and even if I do eat pasta, I prefer capellini/spaghettini/angel hair because I don't like thick chewy pasta. But this was an exception. It was soooo worth the $30. Everything about this dish was amazing. They nailed that black truffle cream sauce. He ended up eating some of my pasta because he loved it that much and trust me, he doesn't usually care for fancy foods. Definitely coming back here again to try other things on the menu, or probably just order this pasta over and over again haha. 


Just a shout out to the staff here for being so friendly. I snuck off to the bathroom to tell one of the waiters that it was my boyfriend's birthday and before I could even ask if there's any birthday specials, they told me they got it. I had no idea what they meant but when I asked for the bill, they brought out this delicious creme brulee with fruits, and a lit candle - and it was on the house! Not all places will give a free dessert for a birthday and they didn't even ask me for proof or anything. Seriously so nice of them. It was great that this was so last minute and they were still able to make our time there special.",1,1,1

My wife thought her pizza was great. She ordered a few toppings which pumped the price up to just about $20 for a 14"" pizza. A bit pricey, but she really enjoyed it so it's all good.

The interior is very small; there are maybe 5 tables plus a small counter.  Expect a wait, but there isn't really a waiting area meaning you wait outside or stand awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant. Staff are consistently very friendly. 

The menu is small but excellent. We tried the chicken karage to start. Excellent! High quality meat instead of that weird grey and slimy meat some places use for karage. I highly recommend the katsu. Perfectly breaded and fried without being greasy or oily. The meat is incredibly tender. Check-in on Yelp for a free potato salad (Japanese style and very good). You grind your own sesame seeds to add to the katsu sauce just like at Saboten in Asia!

Small negative that instead of fountain drinks they only have soda in cans.  Their curry is not breathtaking and tasted basically like a packaged curry, but I can forgive this given their excellent katsu.",1,2,1

Note:
I did have some hiccups in the process where I wasn't completely clear on some of the details of the process, but in retrospect, it was mainly due to my lack of experience rather than Travis's accommodation.

2,"The food and drinks at Tako are a solid 3. The service, particularly by Jacen, and the fun decor bring it to a 4.

This place is fun -- love the ambiance with its big bulbs, tako/octopus themed play on meaning, crazy religious-Mexican drive-in feeling.

But by New York standards, the food and drink are just good, not great. 

The Taco Situation:
Tako: It's a bit flat -- the octopus could use a touch more charring, the greens and oil used bring down the overall taste, and you're left wanting more flavor pow! with each bite.

Duck Confit: I didn't love the pairing of duck and hoisin sauce. The sauce took over a bit too much.

Korean: The hoisin sauce took over way too much with the Korean taco. And I couldn't taste any kimchee in there. It didn't have any hints of Korean flavor at all, really.

The Guac Situation:
The chef's special crab, mango guac was okay -- could barely taste the crab because the jalepenos were way overpowering. Not to mention those 'penos practically burned my lips off.

When in Pittsburgh, Tako is a perfect stop in if you're looking for a fun vibe and some tequila!

We were kindly greeted by our server, Wanda. Cheerful and direct, she let us know that HH just started and the specials for today. She's very informative and details of each dish was emphasized to the point where I could have envisioned it right before my very own eyes! 

Our appetite chose the Shima Aji - Striped Jack (specials), Premium Uni from Santa Barbara (specials), Shigoku Oysters (specials), Avocado Roll (HH), Yuzu Salmon (HH), and Yellowtail Jalapeno (HH).

My loves:

I admit.. all those specials we ordered were FRESH. It felt like we were at sea and they just caught it. Opened, cut it up, and served us ;) Shima Aji had a clean finish.. pure texture as in smooth and rich. If you've been looking for sashimi with no fishy odor/taste and ends with a sweet, calm note.. Shima Aji is the best for Summer! I would order this over and over again. Highly recommend this special while it's around. 

Premium Uni here could possibly seduce you in falling in love with Uni, itself. Obsessive kind of love. Beautiful presentation. The color of a sliced mango.. deep, deep orange. I get a kick out of the grainy texture that reminded me of a very dry tongue. Say Ahhh!!! Buttery, sweet, and fresh tasting. Surprisingly, it has a hint of floral. It came with a generous amount of 4 pieces of Uni per nigiri order. I was in Uni heaven!!! Layer after layer I was relishing each bite. Definitely order this or you're going to be missing out on something truly pleasurable to your taste buds. So good, sooooooooo GOOD. 

Yuzu Salmon presentation had bursting, vibrant colors that made the dish so enticing. Nicely sliced and pleasantly clean flavor.

Unfortunately, the flash flood warning went off at the restaurant and my phone. So we had to scarf down on our last dishes of Avocado Roll and Yellowtail Jalapeno sashimi. Looking through the window from our comfy booth seating.. those clouds look mean.. destructive mean. I had to ask for the check pronto and told our server, Wanda.. my MINI can't survive any floods.. I have to get going.. and she goes.. then you better go. While the staff yells out thank you.. we took off like ghost rider. 

This place was packed during Happy Hour (HH) 5p-6p/10p-2a and love the fact that they played some great UFC/MMA fights while enjoying our meal here. My mom was oddly engaged in those matches. Getting my attention with.. Look! Look at this guy get kneed in the ribs!!! I was like what the heck he lost from that?! UFC/MMA sushi action! Naked Fish is as real as it gets for your Sushi needs!

There was little bulgolgi and quite expensive ($19.99). I got the boneless Korean fried chicken (KFC) because my friend said it is usually really good at other places. It was nothing special. Just regular popcorn chicken only with a dipping sauce not so flavorful. 

There is dish that has rice cake and you can add egg, ramen noodles and cheese to it. That was pretty good however the sauce is really thick and sweet. I just mainly liked it because of the rice cakes. 

My most favorite thing here is the takoyaki. It is always so weird how whenever I go to a restaurant, one of the things that become my favorite there are always the food outside of the ethnic group. The takoyaki was delicious but the fish flakes did not move around much. It barely moved actually, I do not know why...

Customer service from the office was great - quick to respond to the form I submitted on their site, and also quick to confirm the details of my move that same day.

Chris and the two other movers were super friendly, courteous, and careful with my belongings - the original move was estimated to be around 4 hours, and they finished in 2, beating me to my apartment when I went to meet them from the storage unit. They were also thoughtful about where to put the boxes in each of the rooms in my apartment, and arranging them for me so I wouldn't have a hard time later shuffling them around on my own to unpack.

The devil egg was fine (I'm not a fan of deviled eggs in general, so I can admit bias w this one) - my wife really likes deviled eggs, and thought this was a winner. The black rice oxtail risotto was too salty - likely the result of too much parmesan cheese (my wife had been here previously and loved the dish on that occasion, but did not this time. we spoke w the waiter and manager who suggested the oversalt was from parmesan).

5,"Good BBQ in Vegas? It does exist. Rollin Smoke is where you'll find it. When you search for it some people might consider the location to be sketchy. Ignore that, look over at the mobile smokers, and then step inside to a recently renovated space. The bench tables may turn some people off but they are there to encourage people to sit together. But there are smaller tables, and even a second room (it's where the BBQ Grill fish tank is) if you want a little less of a crowd. 

But it's all about the food and Rollin Smoke delivers with excellent Brisket, chicken, and ribs that will make you think you're not in Vegas but in KC or Memphis. I could run long here but let's just say I spent 30 years in KC. I love BBQ. When I crave BBQ this is where I go, period.

1,"Mon Ami Gabi est excellent; bon emplacement et bonne nourriture... Coming to Vegas twice a year for tradeshows, one of my fave must-eat spots has become Mon Ami Gabi. Easy on the pocket book, good ambience, fairly sized portions, and tasty through and through!

Outside of the tourist trap it has become (I guess the location says it all), I prefer this restaurant to many on the strip for a quick meal. Close your eyes and your whisked away to Paris? Not really! But, the meals and service seem to fall in line with it's kitsch boho chic aesthetic. I'm a fan of vintage, what can I say...

We had a lunch and dinner here this week, and both were handled very well. The burger at lunch, with an egg, was fantastic. So good in fact, the gf stole it and swapped lunches with me! Who said chivalry wasn't dead? I ended up having the open-faced crab salad sandwich, not great, but definitely fed my hunger appropriately.

All in all, Mon Ami Gabi gets the thumbs up for always providing a good meal, day or night. Now back to writing the rest of my week of Vegas experience...",1,1,1

5,"When I left here, I felt like I had just been at a friend's moms house. And that is the most sincere compliment that I could give this place. 

Each lunch meal comes with a cup of soup and spring roll. The soup is broth filled with rice, celery, carrots, tofu and not much else. The spring roll is hot and super crispy but filled with only veggies - mostly cabbage. The soup didn't do for it. Sriracha couldn't save it and so I left mine untouched. 

I ordered pad Thai and chicken larb. 

The chicken larb was everything. It was funky, spicy, sour and just done right. The only thing I didn't really like is they served it on top of small pieces of lettuce. It's pretty typical to get larb with big pieces of lettuce or cabbage so you can scoop it up and eat it like that. The larb was some of the best I had in a long time. You can pick your level of spicy from from 1-5, I went with five. And the spice and heat did not disappoint. 

The pad Thai was definitely a lunch version special. It came with 5 shrimps and was light on the egg and bean sprouts. However the flavor was spot on. It had all the flavors you expect from a well balanced pad Thai - sweet, salty, spicy and plenty of umami. 

I'd definitely come back. The staff was friendly, pleasant and attentive without being over bearing. I thought I would be the lone man out eating by myself but seems it's a popular place for a singles lunch.",3,6,1

1,"Peño Mediterranean Grill is a solid contender in Charlotte's local restaurant market.

It's located in a strip mall right outside Arbor Hills - an up-and-coming neighborhood.

Parking is plentiful so you shouldn't have to worry about finding a spot.  Inside, the restaurant is clean and regularly maintained.  There is always someone behind the counter when you walk in.  Staff is cordial and willing to answer questions about the menu.  Seating is in a four-person per table format but you can always join two or more tables together for more space.

The food is cooked in front of you on the grill behind a glass counter.  This is something I personally love because I prefer knowing how my food is prepared ""behind-the-scenes.""  You can ask for customizations to your order, usually for little-to-no extra cost.

Pricing is fair, especially for the quality.  The food itself is fresh, plentiful, and great for a family night out, catering, or even to-go.

While it was good, it was nowhere close to my favorite (alas, I will have to keep looking). I did like that the bagels were small. While some may not feel the same way, I feel like bagels are already filling so with a smaller bagel I can get just enough of a fix ;)  

The lox tasted fresh, which is a good thing here in the desert, but the BEST thing about this place?? They have jalapeño cream cheese!!! Some bagel places have started carrying it, but not all, so I was happy to find another one that has it. It's the BOMB.COM!

We thought it would be easy, just a stamp and go but no, you have to go in play a machine or go to the bar and purchase a min of $10. So we went to the bar and ordered some drinks. 
The girl working the bar was pretty quick to take our order and check our IDs. I order a redbull vodka and my friend order a midori sour. The first thing we noticed was the tiny glass. but what else do you expect at a casino bar. Next I noticed she was using a pourer for the shots. No real bartender does this!! Lol She was doing her job, I asked her if it was required and she laughed and said yes otherwise she wouldn't use it. I noticed they have the liquor guns. Those are super freaking cool!! It pours the shot for you like a soda gun. After we got our first round the total came out to 13.50. Not too bad. We sat and decided to check in. They offered a FREE WELL DRINK!!! I was so stoked.

He didn't do just the plumbing, but designed the bathrooms. They were totally his creation.  From what should be demolished and with what should be replaced, to the tiniest details, like the cool light bulbs he used, the light switches etc.  He chose EVERYTHING, and let me tell you, he has exquisite, good taste.

My husband was kind of giving me a hard time because these 2 projects were nothing but cheap, but at the end, he agreed that if decide to remodel the bathrooms in a house that we have up north in Arizona, he will be the one to do the project.
He went with me to several show rooms, got me the best of the appliances (all of the appliances were changed) and got me very good prices.

He was in charge of the tile, travertine, stalls, EVERYTHING!  Those bathrooms have been the envy of everyone to come to see them.

What he charged was extremely reasonable (my husband compared with other projects and with other plumbers).  This project was $50,000.00 PLUS but because of all the material (the best).  He didn't charge for his ideas, of for all the trips to the show rooms that he had to take, either with me or by himself.

Keith Thompson is not only a plumber, but a designer as well, with a lot of knowledge and, as I said before, with exquisite taste.

12,"Since everyone eventually reviews P.F. Chang's, I thought I would give you all an alternative, a great, Americanized Chinese food restaurant. 

The Golden Phoenix is a great example of a successful Chinese restaurant. They do excel in most ways but  fall short in others. First off, for an appetizer, get the Mu Shu, its the best I've found in town. The Hot and Sour Soup is great too, good balance of flavors. Great noodles, and rice always seems fresh. Most of the chicken and tofu entrees are cooked extremely well, as the chicken is tender and tofu is firm and sauteed well. Now for the not so good, stay away from beef entrees. As most Chinese restaurants, the beef used is from a cut that needs to be finessed, its tough if not cooked delicately, most of the time its cooked too long and gets rubbery, Michelin/Goodyear like. Stick with chicken or tofu. 

As for the service and decor both are better then most. The restaurant looks like a Chinese restaurant should, bright with Asian decor. The service is prompt and professional. 

As a previous review stated, they don't handle parties well, I disagree, I planned a party for 25 and they handled it quite well. In fact when the check came I tipped above the automatic gratuity (reserved for large parties). 
 
Take out is outstanding as I tend to call in my order and pick up rather then a take out from Pei Wei (support the little guy!). To make things easier the menu is available online at their website. 

Here is the web address, at this time though its not loading properly, check again if the page is not available.

What really made me mad was that when I got there she called over to the cook about the slice and they started cooking it then! So I still had to stand and wait there! Why did I even bother calling ahead then?

Cheapest isn't always the best in this case. We came in with a group of 4 including our 4 month old son and we sat in the main area right away. It was Sunday afternoon and so there was no big crowd at all. They had a pretty good selection on the conveyor belt but was shocked to see yogurt, orange juice and cheesecake among others that did not belong there. The sushi was OK but what really brings them down in my eyes was their server. While my wife was chowing down, she picked up some ginger from her plate and found hair wrapped around the ginger. We signaled to the server (younger Asian female) but she was busy tending to other guests and finally after a good 5 minutes she came to our table and we informed her of what we found. We showed her the ginger piece and without expressing concern she just says ""Oh, I'm sorry"". Grabs the plate and walks away. We simply wanted her to acknowledge the fact that yes these is HAIR wrapped around the ginger and they maybe they need to check on their products before setting them on the table. The ginger did not come from the conveyor belt but was brought out from the back. Maybe if they practiced more attention to detail, this would not have happened. We were doing the restaurant a favor by bringing it up and she had something stuck in her behind and did not care at all. It was almost like we made her mad.

6,"If this is supposed to be a taste of Calgary then where is the diversity from around the city?

For the most part, they take the Eau Claire food court and move it outside into tents. Sure there are a few other businesses like Pegasus, but when one of the ""tastes"" is Mini Melts, a large corporation, that doesn't really represent what Calgary has to offer.

Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy myself, but I just expected more from this festival. They advertise that you can get a taste for only $1, but you're going to be hard pressed to find anything for a buck. I saw one place that had a piece of bread. Everything else was at least $2 but averaged between $3-4.

The best area was the beer gardens. This is truly where the festival lives up to its name. There were about a dozen different breweries and liquor vendors to sample.

First off, they didn't give us decent portion of Kim Chi to start with and we had total of 4 people. We all ordered ice-tea and the server did not ask us if we want refill once. I ordered the Gabi lunch dish and it was only average. The last dish didn't show up until we are almost done with our dinner. Service is great, owner seems nice, but it doesn't make up for the small portion of Kim Chi and the food.",1,1,-1
8,"I'll start this off by saying I really wanted to like this restaurant. After hearing mixed reviews I kept an open mind, but unfortunately was dealt a mediocre experience. 

The interior was cute, however you can tell that whoever chose the furniture didn't sit in each seat beforehand. We were at what could have been a cute little Italy type of table, but it was SO little that everyone's knees could not fit underneath it. Definitely more little kid than little Italy.  

Another atmosphere downer was how HOT it was inside. Granted it was 116 degrees outside but the open kitchen layout wasn't helping Bianco's case - nor was the server who kept opening the patio door. 

I will say the food was the best part of our experience, however it was mediocre Italian at best. The spaghetti...was spaghetti. I'd make it at home before coming back to order. The gnochhi was the best dish at the table and it was the corn that really made it. The cavatelli was decent (but I was glad I didn't order it) and our friend who ordered the pappardelle was apparently pleased because he ate it all.

If you're a Bianco fan, I'd say give it a go - maybe you'll get a better table, a less awkward server and food worth going back for; it just didn't happen on our visit.",1,6,-1

The Cafe was hopping with this caffeine wired teens ready for partying and some fun time since TGIF... The line was long, but at least most of the patrons just want a slush or just a straight coffee...so I didn't wait long for my cappuccino..... 

I don't understand why the barista was filling up my Cappuccino ($3.45) right to the rim.. as I started spilling my drink even when I tried to take it slowly to the table.......... 

The coffee itself was MEH... more like a latte and I can barely taste the coffee....

6,"As a steakhouse fan Jacobs in an obvious attraction in Toronto.  The menu looks amazing and features a well thought out and extensive selection of steak from USDA Prime to Japanese A5.  The restaurant itself looks the part with a piano bar downstairs and a lovely dining room upstairs with the aging room on display.  However, on multiple visits i'd never really gone ""this is the best"".  Sometimes the food was very good, sometimes the service was spot on but other times it was just ok.  Our last visit, my last ever visit, was a disaster.  All of our steaks ranging from Prime to Wagyu to Japanese A5 and sides arrived cold or lukewarm (inexcusable at this price point), service was mediocre at best and a bit condescending and pushy at its worst and I left thinking ""what a waste of money"".  Our only mistake was to not send every item back on the spot.  Being polite and voicing our displeasure afterward was greeted with the comment from management that ""the food was eaten""  Yep, that happens when you're hungry and have been waiting too long for the meal to arrive so we ate the cold steak and sides... shame on us and lesson learned.  Either way, once the food arrives cold the experience is ruined and having them cook a new meal would only have delayed us further.  A promise from the manager to ""reach out"" with a phone call still hasn't happened some 5 days later and I no longer care to receive it.  We threw over a thousand bucks out the window on the meal and that'll be the last time it happens.  In my opinion, Jacobs wants so desperately to be in the same league as great steakhouses like Wolfgang Puck's Cut (which is amazing) and Craftsteak but... it just isn't and after this last fiasco i'll not be returning.

1,"We are hungry, we do not want to go on an expedition. We want spicy, cheesy goodness. And a margarita. We decide to hit up Arriba's since they're just up the street, and per our usual chill demeanor, sidle up to the little bar to grab a margarita, and decide what spicy green chile dishes we want to eat. 

Now, I haven't been to this place in a couple years, and the last time I went, was driven there, half in the bag after watching a softball tournament. At that time, maybe I didn't care so much, maybe it was because I couldn't see the bartender making my drinks, I don't know....BUT

If you are a *new* bartender, don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo, instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap,  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses, haphazardly salted, expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour, and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know, one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu, and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space (yes, I can smell your drugstore perfume, and no, it doesn't make you pretty).

Almost every fairway had spots that should have been marked as ground under repair as they were graded and muddy w/virtually no grass on many spots. We were charged $65 for the round. It's unconscionable that they could charge that for a course in such bad shape. I understand the need for revenue, but this was ridiculous.

I showed her a picture that had an ombré style to it... everywhere I go I get told they look like highlights and they do. I have also been told that the color is too yellow for my skin by another hairstylist. Not only that, but the cut was not what I wanted either. My hair was straightened so I couldn't really see the shape my hair had. When I got home and styled it with my natural curl, I still looked like I had triangle head.

Obviously you are a very young and inexperienced business owner.  You take every little Recommendation or Criticism personally and ALWAYS on the defensive.  Other Yelp readers are actually amused  by your inexperience and unprofessionalism with your comments.
Nobody is out to get you. We want to see nice businesses in our community. But please be professional. What happened to the customer is always right?

0,"My husband enjoyed his chicken salad sandwich. My meatloaf was slathered in gravy. The mashed potatoes were really good as was the broccoli. The two stars is because of the wasted $15 on two desserts.   First, they were obviously purchased at Costco but then we would've purchased the entire cake for $15. Instead we spent almost half that on one freezer burned piece of chocolate cake and an equally freezer burned pizookie. My husband asked if my meatloaf came from Costco too. My answer? It's entirely possible. Disappointing. I expect more from a family run restaurant. I'd prefer a limited menu with truly home cooked meals.",1,0,-1

The only thing that was worth any time was the spicy salsa and chips which you could buy at Walmart.

The staff I've interacted with were not very friendly, service from the sports book waitresses was incredibly slow (30 minute wait for bill after requesting), table game minimums are some of the highest on the Strip, and smokier than most of the newer casinos.

Just to give you an example of why I have this opinion on this business. I have visited this salon all of three times and the first time No one address me or greeted me when I entered then they told me I would only have to wait 30 mins to get in a chair. Well 30 mins turned into an hour. In the wait time I noticed that every one that was causcasian that entered after me received a greeting and was promptly asked what they needed unlike I was. the owners brother from out of town did my nails and I will admit they were wonderful. I loved it so much that I went back 2 weeks later. I asked if they had internet for the customers no one would address me as if I never asked. Therefore I had to ask again to only be told in a rude way that the internet is not working. (Most salons have internet for the customers but not theses people) however again the service was wonderful so I thought let me try them again. Well her we go I showed the nail tech a picture of the nails I wanted and she did not speak much English so she asked the lady next to her about it mind you it was only a gel polish with a different color of nudes she turned to me with attitude and said that will be $2 extra I said ok that's fine. About fifteen minutes into the young lady doing my nails the other lady she had asked about the polish turn and said you will have to pay and extra $5 for your polish removal. I informed her I had been her twice and that was not charged to me on either of those visits. She said they must have forget to charge you. I said well you can not change the price of something in the middle of the service she said to me with attitude ""well I'm telling you now."" I asked her to show me where this was listed because usually if your having your nails done they remove the polish for free as long as your replacing it. She said it's over at the door. I went to the door and there was no sign there she then said it's in our pamphlet. I took a pamphlet on my way out the door and let me just say I did not find it in there either!

No one should have to wait 17 minutes to get a dish of ice cream, especially if you are on your lunch break. I understand the time involved in creating your order but this place is in need of some improvements if they want to be successful. Following are some tips for a successful business:
1. Leadership starts at the top....I have not witnessed any management leaders during my visits
2. Customer service is very weak, only 2 employees at a few of my visits which slowed service significantly. This is an operation, not just scooping ice cream....they need a cashier to solely take orders and keep the place clean. 
3. Because this is a new concept it takes a bit of time to understand the workings on how to order. The line is easily backed up with customers trying to place an order, can be frustrating to those in line who are more experienced. Perhaps there should be someone available to help the customers through the process before they order. I'm sure this will get easier as this concept gets more recognized. 
4. This is a fun place to bring the kids...watching them making the ice cream is super cool. Employees could make the experience much more fun and entertaining but I haven't seen that yet! You need to engage your audience! 
Again, leadership starts at the top! It appears to me that after this place opened the only people remaining were inexperienced staff and no one to guide and help them make this experience as great as it should be. This place won't be here long if someone doesn't make improvements!

The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was ""wonderful"". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch.
The wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list.

I used to come here before they rebuilt, and never really had an issue.  It's McDonalds, what can you really say?  Well, I have a lot to say now...  The first time I tried them after the remodel was an absolute DISASTER.  Order was taken pleasantly enough, but that's where it all ended.  They told me, and the 3 other cars in front of me, and several behind, to pull forward and park.  Commence people running out and around our cars frantically trying to figure who ordered what, and they were ALL WRONG.  This was around 10AM on a Thursday mind you, not like a crazy morning rush time.  Eventually all but me and one other person got their orders.  They tried three times to give me the iced version of my hot drink that I ordered, so I finally took it, and left after almost being there for I sh*t you not, THIRTY MINUTES.  My drink was ok I guess, watered down, my food was cold by the time I got it.  
This morning, again, I ordered, and got my food, but was told to pull forward for my hot Caramel Macchiato.  I actually tried to resist afraid of another disaster, but she forced me to pull forward saying it would only be 2 minutes.  I unfortunately pulled forward, and looked in my food bag.  Food looked actually right, a miracle!  About 2-3 minutes passed, and I finally got my drink. Because yet again my fast food experience was not fast at all, I took off trying to get to work on time.  About 3 blocks away at a red light I grabbed my hash brown AND IT WAS FROZEN.  Ice cold, hard in the middle.  
I literally can't even.  
Get to work, realize my drink isn't even HALF full...  And I don't know what the hell it is, but it is NOT a Caramel Macchiato.  It tastes like burnt old coffee, with not even any sweetener.

Even with the misters on, it's a hundred degrees outside. I'm not sure why they kept the large patio doors open. So anyway, the atmosphere was great. Candles lit and dim lighting. Could be very romantic and posh but, instead of Bocelli or Sinatra they were playing Smashmouth and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was so ""off"" for this type of establishment. What made it even more awkward, was our waitress kept dancing and signing near us like we were in a club. Not very professional for such a nice place but again, whatevs. The wine list was not impressive at all. In fact, we both had a really hard time deciding because there was so little to pick from. I mean, I've seen a couple of these bottles at Target, come on. Since you can order by the glass, we did since buying a bottle of something they had was just not going to be an option. 
 I ordered the chicken vodka penne. My friend ordered the Godfather pizza and we had a Caesar salad. Right away when the food came out, we both kind of looked at each other surprised and he said to me, ""Uh, that was fast. There's no way they cooked that pasta just now"" I agreed. The pasta sauce was great but the chicken was dry and I kept thinking, it was like it was made for something else and they just cut up and tossed it in my penne. The salads were delish though!

5,"Just want to point out that Vine has yet to receive a 5-star review. It's pretty clear to me now. We went as a last minute choice for my dad's birthday. We've never been to this building (I say building because it has been so many different restaurants over the years). I would figure this place gets plenty of traffic as it is situated right in the heart of Ballantyne. It wasn't full, though, on the Saturday night we went. In fact, I'd say only 50-75% of the seats were taken.

We were promptly seated and seen by a few different waiters before actually getting ""our"" waitress. I ordered ribs, my dad a hamburger, my sister chicken, and my mom salmon. After about 20 minutes, the food came out. Interestingly enough, my hand towel for my ribs came out 10 minutes before any food was served...which doesn't really make sense. 

The food came out, and the first thing I noticed was how hard my ribs were. Usually, you can take a knife and break apart the ribs like melted butter, but this time, I had to bend back a rib, and cut it before it came apart. The meat was tough--possibly overcooked? I pointed this out, and it was quickly taken back. A new plate of ribs arrived about 15 minutes later, which was MUCH better, but still not great. While soft, there were fat nubs on the ends, and the sauce wasn't great. I think they were short ribs which are usually of lesser quality than baby back, which I was annoyed about. If I'm paying $19 for ribs (or whatever it was), I'd like good quality ribs.

They gave us a free dessert because of the ribs. We got the banana cream pie, which was just bad. The pie crust was not good at all, I took a bite and was done. Everyone else said their dinner was average as well.

Would I come back? Doubtful--this place left me unimpressed.",3,2,-1
0,"I live very close to AnSun, so I was hoping for a great new spot!  Unfortunately, after visiting with my bf and two friends who were in from out of town, I left disappointed.  

I agree with many other reviewers.  My dish (kung pao chicken) was very tasteless and underwhelming.  Mine tasted nothing like what another reviewer talked about!  My bf was shocked that they could make a spicy dish...with no flavor.  Yes, they used nice pieces of white meat, but who cares when the dish is difficult to eat!  

The menu needs to be reworked.  My friends visiting from CA kept saying that they thought the place needed to just focus on one type of cuisine, or at least integrate the foods a little better.  The menu goes from wings to American entrees to Chinese food.  I actually don't mind the variety...but it needs to be carried out better, and the design of the menu itself needs a huge upgrade.  I've never really taken much note of a menu's ""design"" before, but this one is just done so immaturely, I guess I would say, that it made the food items seem less appetizing!

While my kung pao chicken was pretty terrible, my bf and other friend really enjoyed their Southwest burgers! We also ordered potato skins.  They were really just four thin slices of potatoes loaded with potato skin fixings.  Tasted good, but I was very surprised/disappointed by how small they were! I was hoping that this place would be more than just another ""bar food"" place, but it doesn't seem like that is going to be the case. 

Because of its close proximity to my house, I'm sure I will give AnSun another try in the future. However, I will definitely not be taking any more out-of-town guests with me!

P.S. They were also still out of nachos...weird.",1,0,-1

My battery and brake lights are on, went there to have it fixed, you know what their diagnosis? faulty dashboard!!! what a joke, after paying $170 they sent me on my way with my brake lights and battery still on,  My car went dead afterwards and they are charging me $720 for new battery and alternator.  They finally realized what was wrong with it and is overcharging me, they said the alternator cost $420 alone service is $150, i told them i will buy the alternator.  Went to Autozone Decatur to buy the $114.95 alternator and met the awesome Mobile Mechanics, who took  my car from this awful shop and repaired it for an hour.  They charged me only $100.  Yeah USA auto have cheap smog and change oil but they will look for ways and means to  get you to pay more.  Beware, their mechanics don't know what their doing.",0,0,-1

My husband didn't think to look at Molly's ears after hearing this. As soon as I got home from school, I examined her ear and it appears my dog Molly's ears have been cut, yes CUT. Dried blood, two cuts, etc on both ears. My dog, Molly has been under the bed since I have gotten home.

I am in medical school-you can't BS me. Also, my husband and myself both brush Molly every day. Her ears also get examined because our doodle is prone to ear infections.

4,"For a high end steak house, this place was inexcusably mediocre.

The service was incredibly slow. We had a group of 6 and waited an hour and a half for our food. They weren't slammed or busy. Nobody apologized for the wait and we literally had to flag down a food runner at some point to ask if our food was almost ready. Needed a refill on my $14 cocktail for awhile but that never happened.

When our food finally arrived, it was lackluster at best. I got a New York strip steak. It was just plopped on a plate by itself, no garnish or anything. It was sooooo chewy and rubbery. I was working up a sweat trying to cut through it with my knife. I've had a bad steak or two in my life but when I'm paying $43 for just a steak, no sides, I expect a great cut of meat. I couldn't even finish it. No one in my party was overly impressed with the food. My foodie friend ordered scallops with forbidden rice but they served the dish with regular rice hoping she wouldn't notice. She's not an idiot. She called them out and they stammered and flailed saying they just ran out. Why wouldn't they just tell her that beforehand? She would have ordered something else. My other friend ordered a side of asparagus and they weren't cooked properly and ended up being hard and bitter.

Every single one of us felt gross after we left. The greasy sub par quality food just sat in our stomach like a brick and we ALL ended up paying for it later. (Sorry but we did!)

When I opt for fine dining, I expect to pay higher prices for the entire experience. Paying as much as we did for what we got felt like a total rip off. If I wanted a crappy steak that would haunt me all night, I would have just gone to Ellis Island and paid $5.",5,3,-1

They then called me later and told me the car had been sold earlier and that they should not have reserved the car for me.  They said it was a system mixup.  I was able to cancel my airline at not cost.  The manager said he would have reimbursed me for the airline tickets had it come to that.  But overall not a good experience so I would caution people who think that there may be a car available...don't assume it is just because they tell you it is or because it shows up on the Internet.

5,"My review is solely for Delta offices/customer service communications, managers, sales,  etc.. actually the workers: Jose and his team-- were probably the companies' ONLY saving grace to keeping us as customers. 

First off, this company is so unprofessional and their lack of communication is close to none. We were originally scheduled for an install for the 18th of July and they promised it would all be taken care of and the turn around time would only be 1 day of work. WRONG! 

The company calls us and tells us that they need to reschedule our install date to Monday the 21st bc there's no available times anymore for the 18th--ok we're ok with that.  Sunday comes around and they call us around 5pm to tell us that they have to reschedule the install to TUES, July 22nd now because they didn't know the machines wouldn't be available yet. (ok fine, lets take ANOTHER day off). 

thats not even the worst part!!!

Tuesday comes around, they finally get to the house (2 hours after they say they would, btw) the workers are great --Jose and his team work fast and seem to know what their doing.  BUT halfway through the job they tell us that they're boss just called them and told them they had to stop the job because they didnt turn in the permits in time to the city so basically they (Jose and the workers) would get in trouble for continuing their work. so basically, halfway through the job--unfinished work--they had to stop.  COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL AND UNORGANIZED. the Manager's reasoning was that ""they had a runner on his way to get the permit"" --HOW DOES THAT JUSTIFY ANYTHING? 

 the manager just proved my point how unorganized they are if they didnt have that stuff taken care of BEFORE their workers came into work! So completely unprofessional. Im a little irritated that Home Depot recommended them, too!

I'm not sure why we weren't charged when we did in fact order it. So we paid for a cup. 5 minutes later there was still no coffee and had to ask again if there was some reason for the delay.

I came from New York and thought Las Vegas is cheaper I was very wrong on that aspect.,1,0,-1
1,"I had been coming here for years since I go to ASU and it is so close to school. However, the quality and customer service has literally taken a dive since the management changed hands. The technician the last time I went was very rude, kept hurting my nails and insisting that I needed ""longer nail"" and ""short nail look bad"". I understand that if you charge me more you can make more money but perhaps you should focus more on customer service instead of making your customers feel bad while they are there. 
Also- I got SNS powder dip nails and the color was not even close to the swatches they had and didn't even last a week before it was lifting off my nails.
The price is on the higher end for nail salons and with the product not lasting and horrible customer service, I can say that I will never go back to this place ever again.",0,0,-1
0,"This branch is unbelievably awful.  I have been banking with BofA for over 15 years now, and my skin crawls any time I have to go to this branch.

1.  The parking lot is RIDICULOUS and impossible to navigate.  There are 40 different one-ways in a PARKING LOT and you have to know exactly which entrance/exit to turn in or you can't get to the window, or to a drive-up ATM, or to the walk-up, or to the door.  It is insanity.

2.  The Loomis truck is there EVERY STINKING DAY for OVER an hour.  I do not like to get out of my car in this neighborhood (for obvious reasons) and so I prefer to drive up.  I waited for thirty minutes while he blocked all the drive-up ATMs today.  Finally I drove around (illegally) to the walk-up and swore on my dead mother that if I was robbed I was going to sue BofA and Loomis for it.

3.  The customer service is TERRIBLE.  They did not call me when my foreign funds came in, they had no idea how to ""sell"" me the foreign funds, and the line is always insanely long.

I highly recommend going to a different branch versus wasting time and risking your life (and drivers license) trying to park/bank at this one.",0,0,-1

The rooms are getting a little long in the tooth, there was dust on top of the fire sprinkler head in the bathroom (doesn't anyone ever dust those things?) The windows had some sort of adhesive long left to turn brown where something like maybe a film was used for sun shading, the vent on the air conditioner was loose. I have a stayed at the Holiday Inn Express in Victoria, Texas that was a nicer larger room with amenities that the ""great"" Luxor didn't even offer - no thanks - The staff was nice but a 85$ ""RESORT FEE"" watch out they don't tell you about that when you make a reservation through American Airlines vacations - so calculate that into the cost of your room(s)",0,0,-1

But then the 4 good sized pieces of fish, the server promised came out on a plate where it seemed the fries and coleslaw were tossed on first. So coleslaw was warm. It was different from what we had been accustomed to. It tasted alright. The fish was a bit tough and rubber like. No flavor. The breading was nice, golden and crispy. The tatar sauce was really good. The fries were SUPPER YUMMY!! Were thinking we knew something was up when we walked in....and we're right!!

1,"We've been visiting this restaurant off and on for over two years. Each time we go, the service is wretched so we'd wait a few months and try it again. The staff turns over quickly and never seems to be properly trained. But, the food is good which is what kept us going back. Went back today after 6 months or so. The service was even worse than before and seemed far more chaotic than usual. We sat outside. Waited over 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink order. It got worse from there...appetizer was dropped off by a random server and left without providing plates, napkins, utensils. We waited a few minutes then ended up stealing some from other tables. Our server brought our wings out along with a tray full of food for another table. She struggles to get outside with the tray, dropped off our wings and struggled to get back inside with the full tray. She had no plates, no utensils, no dressing or celery. So we sat...and sat...and sat. When we finally got everything we needed to eat, the wings were no longer hot. As all of this was going on, it was obvious that it wasn't the servers who were at fault. It was lack of organization and direction. We asked to see the manager.

The owner/manager comes out and we explained the whole scenario and how frustrated we were. She proceeded to say that she didn't know the weather was going to be so nice and that everyone would want to be outside so she didn't have the staff to manage the customers efficiently. According to her, all of the servers who were there were ""making $10/hour and twiddling their thumbs."" She went on to say that she ""didn't even have enough food and had been shopping for the last hour to buy more. I'm not making excuses but that's the way it is."" I told her that we'd given them many chances and that it's obvious that the problem is with management not the servers and that we wouldn't be back. Her response? ""That's your prerogative."" Now we know why the service is so poor and turnover is so high...it trickles down from the top.",0,0,-1
5,"I also wish I could give NO stars. I as well found them through Groupon and the only reason I went with this company because they had some great reviews on WeddingWire. I do hope that this does help any new customer to be aware of the customer service and quality of what RitzyCakes/ ArizonaBirthdayCakes really offers (This is the same company)...

We ordered a simple three tier cake with sugar flowers for our WEDDING... I did call before I bought the Groupon and they said they couldn't take that offer from Groupon but will give me a deal.  So I talked about what I wanted and they keep adding to the price for flowers, cake tasting and to get it delivered. 

After I paid way too much, I scheduled our cake tasting in advance and with short notice they cancelled my appointment since they ""double booked themselves.""  That was understandable but when we finally had our appointment Tish did not have any of the pictures I have sent to her assistant or our file about what we have bought. Luckily I had pictures I brought that I give to her to explain what we wanted.

When the cake tasting was over I felt that she had understood everything I wanted for my cake. As a very organized bride to be, I did follow up about what we discussed and did not hear back from them in a MONTH. I sent 2 emails, called and nothing. So finally I got ahold of them and this is when everything went downhill. AFTER 32 EMAILS and multiple phone calls she still could not understand that I wanted!!! ONE MONTH before the wedding, I was so stressed out. 

Then she sent me an email the day of the wedding and the cake looked nothing that I wanted!!! I was so disappointed and when she delivered the cake she did not do anything to set the cake table up (she did say to get everything and leave it on the table so she can make the table look amazing) At this point I just didn't care for the cake at all. I was lucky to have a great florist that helped remove all the FAKE FLOWERS off the cake and replace them real ones from an extra center piece we had. The only nice thing I can say is that it did taste good.

Overall, I am completely disappointed in their lack of been organized, listening to the customer, the quality of the cake. I hope this helps any new brides on customer from going through all the trouble. I definitely do not recommend ArizonaBirthdayCakes/Ritzy Cakes.",0,0,-1

8,"Went here on a Saturday afternoon with my girlfriend after being recommended by a friend. 

We arrived at 2:40 knowing that they close at 3 and that the place was in-demand. Although there were two parties in front of us waiting to be seated, we were told that we 'may or may not' be seated before the kitchen closes at 3 but that we would be given some indication within the next 5 to 10 minutes. So we decided to stay until they told us it wasn't happening. 

Over the next 20 minutes, the two parties in front of us ended up being seated and the hostess returned to us three times letting us know that she's pushing tables along. Not once was it said that we probably wouldn't get a seat and that we should leave.

Meanwhile, two parties after us were turned away being told they wouldn't be seated. 

At 3pm, there were three tables paying for their meals yet we were told, at that very moment, that the kitchen had closed and that we wouldn't get a seat. 

I have never written a review on Yelp before but this experience prompted me to post one. 

After a party has waited 20 minutes for a table and was not told once to leave due to the likelihood of not being seated, you do not tell them to leave, especially as it's visible that parties are moments from vacating their tables. 

Service and expectation management was absolutely poor. Even though I have a few friends vouching for this place, this experience alone has made me NOT want to try it and make it a point to let others know. 

We ended up walking over to Bonjour Brioche just a few blocks west and had an excellent brunch there. The service, food and atmosphere was very pleasant and my girlfriend repeatedly described Bonjour Brioche as being cute and her favourite brunch spot in Toronto so far. 

If anything, I'd like to thank Lady Marmalade for turning us away as we were able to try Bonjour Brioche.",1,0,-1

Service: 7/10
Overall experience: 7/10

Why I pretend my star rating relates to my food/atmosphere/service/overall breakdown I don't know...since the math clearly doesn't add up let me explain myself: 

The food here is fine. Some items are really good - I particularly enjoyed the potato gratin and the harvest salad. Others are forgettable.

The service is fine as well - our waiter, an older gentleman, seemed a bit off in a way (quiet, and almost uninterested) but they did do little things like bring some items on two dishes because they knew we were sharing.

The interior is very autumn - cozy and with the smell of the fireplace, it's definitely a spot for September - November. 

The reason it gets 2 stars is really because what you get is not worth what you pay. There are so many choices in Toronto that offer this intimate, ""whole food"" experience, and in all honesty, the bar has been raised. Woodlot falls a bit short. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: everything is fine, but it's not worth your time to go out of your way.",2,1,-1

Police activity has increased to weekly to deal with the drug overdoses that occur at this complex. So I suggest if you don't want to pay these rent prices to live next to meth/heroin addicts, look for some other place to live as Liv says there is nothing they can legally do to clean up the complex. 

Make sure on your tour that they show you the middle beach pool, they usually try to avoid taking people there because it is disgusting. They don't clean the pool especially on the weekends or after holidays and several times there have been feces in the pool.

First, I'll talk about the food. Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything ""well done"" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.

Service - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service.

3,"Based on our recent dinner, I don't think I'll ever go back to a Bill Johnson's restaurant...at least not for dinner. Breakfast there is pretty good and often times worth the miserable service, but dinner? Not again.

We went recently.  Took 20 minutes for salads to come out of the kitchen. I don't know what's going on back there, but the restaurant was NOT full and there was no need for it to take 20 minutes. Salad is the basic bagged salad, a couple of grape tomatoes with dressing in little portion cups. How hard is that to put together and why did it take 20 minutes? A question for the ages I'm afraid. 

Our server was moody. She went from being friendly and interested to not filling a drink on our table in the 20 minutes it took her to get our salads out. She ignored us when she did come out of the kitchen to attend to her other tables. When she did bring the food, Dr. Jekyell appeared again and she was nice as could be and filled our drinks, only to disappear again while we ate. Thank goodness we didn't need anything because we weren't getting it. 

I ordered the Ribeye special. Since I received my education in the culinary field, I can confidently say that the piece of meat I received was NOT a ribeye. Since it took so long to come out of the kitchen though, I suffered through once again thinking of my motto to NOT eat at chain restaurants again.... There was so much fat on this piece of meat that I made a neat litle pile of it on my plate for the server to notice. She noticed but said nothing.  The mashed potatoes were instant potatoes and the corn on the cob was over-cooked and dry. But it was only $12.99.

Oh and don't bother with the $2.99 margarita special. You get what you pay for and that's not saying much. 

I've given Bill Johnson's many a try over the years because back when I was a kid, this was a great restaurant to go to and the food was always really good. As of today....I think the only way they stay in business is because of their breakfast. It sure ain't the dinner or the service. 

I am hoping this is my last visit to Bill Johnson's but alas, I'll probably try them again in a few months hoping that they will be like they were years ago, but I'm sure reality will kick me in the gut again, much like the crappy dinner we had on Friday night. *sigh*",2,0,-1

They seemed to not want my business. So I came back shortly thereafter. The guy was gone and every question I had about the shirt, the girl had no idea, she was clueless. So I waited around a little while waiting for the guy to come back to give me some ridiculous price of $55 for a designed shirt and he had the audacity to tell me he is charging me $10 for bringing in my own shirt! (I wanted a Fitted T and wasn't sure they'd have one so I bought one ahead of time). I ended up leaving and went to Chinook Mall and went to the custom T-shirt designer on the left side of the mall in the walking area (Towards the Theater).

The person at the counter left us with the impression we should know what we want immediately when we walked in, not saying that is the case, just our impression.

The staff seem tired, so does the environment, and the hot dogs are way OVERPRICED for what you get.

The best part is the giant tip jar at the til: for what? staring me down obnoxiously while we try to figure out what our order was? For taking my payment? 

So overpriced hot dogs, tired environment, and customer service that needs some review by the owner/boss. All in all, try another spot.

10,"Ok. Let me first start with the food. This is some the best fried chicken I have ever had. We ate the sandwich and the fried chicken and waffles and both were spectacular.

Unfortunately, overshadowing the food was a pretty abysmal performance from front of the house. The menu is confusing as heck. Some items are only for dinner, others only brunch, and some all day. The server explained this and then proceeded to point out between five and ten menu items that are not available. Then the drink menu was set on the table, telling us to ask for the beer selection. Upon asking we were told only PBR in a bottle because they have yet to secure kegs. I'm no beer snob and I love PBR, but I'm not sure why this wasn't settled before they opened their doors.

Our waitress disappears for ten minutes or so before she returns to take our order. The place is not busy, with maybe five tables and three servers. This is a theme for the remainder of the meal. 

With orders in we settle back to drink and chat. After fifteen minutes we have not seen our server at all. The manager comes out and kindly explains our food will be out soon, apologizes and with a wink says to talk to him when we want to settle up. Great, this is exactly what he needed to do. Our food is brought out, its delicious, and we decide we won't need to call on the manager when we leave. 

However, we still haven't seen our server and now can't get the bill. The manager walks by so we ask him and he gets a hostess to bring our bill. Full charge for everything despite the aforementioned wink and we leave the money on the table not having seen our waitress for almost thirty minutes.

The carving station also was serving roast beef that looked really bad they couldn't even cut it it was so touch. Also no gelato station like before. The lunch buffet was a mix of breakfast and some lunch food. All bad quality. With a players card it's like $11.90 without $2 higher.

First off, they advertise themselves as being the Crab Leg central of Las Vegas. If by ""crab leg,"" they mean ""cold small crab fingers/slivers,"" then yes, this is your place. 

Second, the rest of the buffet was mismatched, random and clearly lacking in any menu planning whatsoever.  You would have a carving station with lamb (no prime rib on the Sunday Brunch Menu, go figure), then next to it, you would have enchiladas, then scrambled eggs. Nothing made sense.

12,"This place is more about being Instagram-worthy and less about actual quality. 

I really wanted to like this place. Don't get me wrong, it's an adorable set-up with super cute decor, but if I end up spending $63 on what's essentially toast and bougie tea, I expect more from the supplier. I have no problem dropping cash on something that I deem is worth the price tag, but there is no way I could justify paying as much as I did for the product that was turned out to me at Cafe Lola. 

My friend and I each ordered the Vanilla Rose Latte, which is supposedly a signature drink of theirs. It tasted like water with a very faint essence of rose. Definitely not worth the equivalent of the $12.96 we paid for each drink. I also ordered the Butter Me Up toast, which is basically a single piece of toast with almond butter and some fruit on top. If I'm spending $10.18 on a piece of TOAST, I expect more from what was served to me - maybe thick, artisanal bread that was baked that morning with some kind of garnish on the side. Not something I could've made at home for half the price. 

My friend got the Let's Avocuddle toast, which looked a little more hearty, but still didn't warrant paying $10.56. She also got a salad - that was probably the only thing ordered that we felt the price matched the product. 

For 5 items, the total was $63, and I felt like I flushed my money down the toilet when I paid for it. So absolutely not worth it at all. Again, I have no problem paying that amount if the product that was turned out matched in quality, and this was far from it. Basically, if all you care about is Insta-worthy food and drinks, this is your place. I'd personally suggest saving your money for a place that turns out a more quality product for your dollar.",2,2,-1

So we went on a Wednesday night, arriving just after 5 PM. The place was pretty empty still, and we were seated by the interior window overlooking the grill station. 

Our waitress got us our drinks and was ready to put our food in pretty quickly. We decided on the NY strip dinners, his with broccoli, me with the baked potato everyone speaks about so much on here. And we did the onion rings as an appetizer.

The onion rings came out first. There were about 7-8 on a pole stand, massive and done in a beer batter. They came with a tangy horseradish mixed dip, which I enjoyed dipping them into. But after the second one we each had, we found the batter got a bit soggy. Now, granted, we couldn't eat them fast enough because they were huge and HOT!  But by halfway down, we were queasy from the grease and the heaviness of the batter. If you're going to get them, have at least 3-4 people split the order. We brought 3 of them home to reheat today because we just couldn't finish them.

The salad bowl came out while we were still munching on the onion rings. It was a fair amount of salad. I enjoyed the eggs in it, and all the fixings. What was really nice was the fact that I had just mentioned Blue Cheese dressing to the girl, and when she said it's a shared salad usually served with house Italian, I canceled out the dressing. However, when the salad came, it contained both the usual Italian in a cup AND a cup of the Blue Cheese for me. Nice!

I was anticipating the hot yeast rolls, thinking they'd be like O'Charley's or Cody's in Florida. But they were stale, crusty on the outside and dry/crumbly on the inside. I didn't even finish one. Took two bites, one of each sliced side, and put them down.  :(

The dinners came out as we were finishing our salads. No one cleared the plates, so it was a little tight on the tabletop. We stacked as much as we could, but thought it odd that they left everything there for us to maneuver around.

His had a good 2 cups of pre-buttered broccoli and his steak, ordered medium-rare, which came out more on the rare side. He didn't complain as he enjoyed the flavor and the sear. But I know he would have liked it a little more done.

Mine I ordered rare, as usually they overcook it, and this one came out barely that. Actually, I only ate a few pieces off the end of mine because it was totally underdone. Now, being that I worked in restaurants for years, I know better than to send something back and be a complainer, so I ate half the potato, which was pretty good (and huge!!!), being that I didn't know about the black blob in it at the time, and saved the steak for today. Knowing I was going to reheat it today made it being undercooked an ok thing. 

The husband still had half his steak and the onion rings for today, too.

0,"Hi Sam (general manager) my name is Diane. I was a guest at your restaurant in the afternoon. I have to say I was quite disappointed at the service, and quality of the food. We are weekly guests at the Nellis Location and felt that we would receive the same or better service at your location. I would like to start by saying we were a party of 5. We weren't offered a wine sample, we were then greeted by Rumel. She went off to say what would you like to drink and stated she hoped we all had salad because it was easier for her. Once we gave her the drink order I explained that I was on short time that I needed my order to be put in along with our salad and drink order so it could all come out at the same time. She said ok and left. When she came back with our drink order our salad was not as ordered I asked her for the missing items and extra dressing. She then had to confirm our order, she stated she couldn't even read her own writing. We were never offered cheese the first or second time around. Then about 10 minutes went by and she noticed we were just sitting there with our plates full of salad she asked if everything was ok at this point I said well we need cheese, and refills on drinks please. That took another 5 minutes. After we were done with that our order was still not out. She then came out with a tray that had only 5 plates and out of that only 1 of them on that tray was ours. She stated that the ""manager"" was placing the food on the trays and they didn't know what they were doing. She then left again and about 10minutes later someone else comes out with 3 more of our plates. So we still have 1 person with no food. And guess who that one person was? Yes me the person that told her that had short time on her hands. So once it comes out again it is not how we had ordered it but since I had 15mins to eat I just ate 2 spoonfuls and boxed it up. Should I say again no one was offered cheese once again. When she noticed that I was irritated by the whole ordeal she offered me a drink to go and said I could pay on the machine on the table. She walked away and didn't see her again. So we paid and of course didn't receive any mints or was checked on again. I am so surprised this even happened to us and I had no chance to talk to a manager or even yourself! That is the reason why I called you as soon as I left the restaurant.

2,"Location is close to the Tempe Beach Park and Hayden Butte (""A"" Mountain). I heard about this new BBQ place so decided to check it out for myself. The inside of the restaurant is quite big, almost too big in my opinion. I had the 1/2 chicken plate with fries and salad which the salad was fresh and the fries were good. However, the chicken was not as good as some other BBQ places that I have been to. The biggest issue I had with the meal was that they only have plastic utensils here and not proper cutlery to dig through the meat. This was very disappointing and I even asked other staff if there were any available to use. While the food was fine in general I'm not sure if I will come back because of this.",1,1,-1

2,"Wish I had read the previous review. Unbelievable rip off. 

The owner, Dan, showed up at my house to fix my dishwasher. The dispenser needed to be replaced and he told me that after a 65$ service call it would be an additional $223 to fix the dispenser. I asked him how much the part was costing and he told me he was charging me over $100 dollars for it. I then looked up the part online and saw that it was $40 bucks on amazon. You have got to be kidding me. What a joke!

I also asked him to look at another appliance while he was here and he told me he wouldn't unless he was paid more (Even though I had already paid him to come out) 

Don't use this company. Find someone else to come help you out ORRR it may even be cheaper to just go buy a new dishwasher.

1,"I've been to a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the past, mainly in Tampa where I live.  Most of my experiences at this chain have been average.  I went to this location after a work function while I was in Cleveland as the locals wanted to gather here for some reason.  Thinking it was the middle of the week with not much going on, I figured it would be a run of the mill outing.  

They had good drink specials I suppose, but the service was lacking.  It took almost 10 minutes after my arrival to even be approached by a team of servers that was tending to our table of 10-15.  Once I placed my order it took another 10-15 minutes to receive my Diet Coke and Water.  Not sure what the hold up may have been.  I suppose they may have been waiting for enough snow to melt to fill up my water glass.  

Anyhow, once our orders were placed there was mass confusion.  None of the orders came out together.  People got wrong items or items were missing all together.  I guess having 3-4 people waiting on a table of 10-15 is just not enough???  

The one thing that made the experience enjoyable at least was that they had on screen trivia going so it helped pass the time.  I guess this may have been a way restaurant management thought to entertain customers who have to wait for slow service.",1,0,-1

4,"This review is Directly to the Owner in hopes it will improve your business. I came here on Wednesday night of this week after finding your business on yelp. The parking lot was empty and the business appeared dark so i called the number to see if they were open. A young lady answered i asked what time do you close her response i dont know. I asked what is your address her response i dont know. She asked someone in the background. Why doesnt your staff know the hours or address?well i soon discovered Why after entering the establishment. I enter and walked to the front counter to place  my order. There are no menus only a hand written erase board. I was NOT greet but instead a young girl stared like a deer on the headlights. I ordered escovitch fish but couldnt pronounce escovitch so i said the fish with the E word in front. She had noooooooo idea what i was talking about. Soon an older man and woman came to the rescue and told the cashier the name. So typical it is fried fish with hot spices and pickled veggies. On the sign it says $8 not $8+. So the man said a i have is small fish, i dont want to give you that. It will be $10 and i will give u a bigger fish. I agreed. My total was $10.82 i gave the cashier $11. She did NOT know how to count back change i had to tell her it was 18cent after she spent 2 minutes counting numbers in her head. This child needs to be school.learning math not behind a register.  Im sorry i feel so sorry for her the school system.failed her. An older lady brought my to go order to me and she asked if i was ok because she say i looked bothered i said yes but u need to get your cashier a calculator she doesnt know basic math her respond i know i know she has a calculator up there im sorry. Anyway i arrive home 15 minutes later to eat my food. It was Disgusting.  Omg. It tasted like hard double cardboard fried old fish with spicy sauce and a few pieces of picked veggies. I threw it away. 
Note to management serve fresh hot fish not old fish
Dont upcharge customer the fish when you sign doesnt say it

I wanted to get a new large rolling gate, add a pilaster, 3 small gates,hardware with a code to unlock, and a new gate motor for the rolling gate.

i reached out to them through messenger here on yelp, they responded well and we set up an appointment to come take a look at what i needed done (this would be my second price -the 3rd company wasn't interested in coming out).

the guy showed up on time... but greeted me kind of weird/rudely.... i was doing stuff in my back yard when i saw him pull up and i called him over to the side gate.

showed him everything i wanted done, and i guess some stuff they didn't do, such as the pilaster (although they said they could help with this on yelp messenger) and the gate hardware (other company quoted for the whole project), which i guess was fine, i have a concrete guy and hardware is easy enough. he was standoffish at every question i asked -he clearly didn't want to be here.

He wanted to sit and go over some things, i brought him to my patio table and he was insulted that i didn't invite him in the house (my wife was newly pregnant and puking her guts out and she didn't want anyone inside), the other gate guy didn't need or want to go in my house so i didn't think it was a big deal.

he acted very insulted and he couldn't be bothered to sit at my recently cleaned off patio table. he would take it back to the office and get me a price within 2-3 weeks!!!!

well, at this point i knew i would never dare to use a company that would send a sales guy so out of touch with dealing with customers, especially if it took 2-3 weeks to get a number together.... but obviously that number never came and i assume he never had the intention of sending it... so i spent my $9k at a competing company that treated me nicely.",0,0,-1

1,"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.On February 10, 2015 we started negotiations for a second mortgage with mortgage agent Tatania Cabral of Mortgage Associates of Ontario. We made it adamantly clear the contact was to close no later than February 26, 2015. Ms. Tatiana Cabral assured us that she could meet that deadline but never did. The contract did not close until 2 months later on April 10, 2015. Ms. Tatiana Cabral deliberately delayed the closing of the mortgage to force us into borrowing $12,000.00 more than we needed. Ms. Tatiana Cabral also had us pay for an appraisal that she promised to pay for half. To this day she has not reimbursed us. We tried to retrieve our monies, the Financial Service Commission of Ontario even intervened and delved into an area that is not within their scope and requested Mortgage Associates of Ontario pay for part of the appraisal and to this day refused to do so. 


We had no other option but to file a Statement of Claim in Toronto Small Claims Court, Mortgage Associates of Ontario they refused to acknowledge and we received a default judgement in the amount of $1913.76. We tried to serve Mortgage Associates of Ontario with a Notice of Examination on August 30, 2017($2071.94) and they refused to cooperate and have someone accept the papers that was someone in authority. 


Due to their unwillingness to cooperate, we have been forced to print up hundreds of posters detailing our experience with Mortgage Associates of Ontario, Tatiana Cabral, Amir Kay and New Haven Mortgage Corporation. While Tatiana Cabral was delaying the closing of the Mortgage she blamed everything on New Haven Mortgage Corporation, stating that I needed a new passport, that we could no longer pay our property taxes. At one point in time she demanded that we retain a lawyer to do all the work on the second mortgage at our expense. We will continue to travel to Toronto to distribute the posters. We have friends in Toronto that will help will us put the posters in hotspots all over the city. We plan to tell everyone who is willing to listen about our experience with all the parties that were part of the negotiations.",0,0,-1

The waitress arrived with 2 egg rolls but we told her not to bother to go back to the kitchen for the remaining order.  Glad we did because the egg rolls tasted stale as though they sat around for a week and were reheated for serving.  The dipping sauce was a spicy chili sauce and it was terrific, especially in offsetting the stale flavor of the egg rolls.  The main course of honey chicken itself was tender and had no grizzle.  However the dish lacked any flavor whatsoever.  There was a sparing amount of glaze on the plate which accompanied the chicken but it too didn't add much taste to the dish.  I wouldn't order the egg rolls and the honey chicken again.  The big surprise was the brown rice.  It was awesome.  It was tender and cooked to perfection.

1,"from its name, ""BRGR bar"" sounds like a bar/lounge that sells specialty burgers. from the way BRGR treats its customers, it's a snobby expensive restaurant that turns away paying customers for no good reason.

first time i went there, i came with a group of 7 people for dinner and drinks. we waited for about 30 or 45 minutes patiently waiting for our table (as other smaller groups got sat). then we saw 2 tables open up right next to each other and we asked if they could put them together.  they said NO, but couldn't give us a good reason why (they actually said they just couldn't move the tables). there was no one behind us in line. the only tables that could accomodate us were still eating and clearly wouldn't open up for awhile. the two adjacent smaller tables just sat empty for 10-15 minutes when finally, we got fed up and argued with them until they realized they had NO good reason for why they couldn't put the tables together and finally sat us.  it seemed like they initially didn't want to do it b/c they are too ""good"" to move tables around to accomodate patrons.

the last time i went to BRGR, i tried to go there for drinks at around 9:30pm.  the restaurant area was mostly empty, 5-6 tables were open downstairs and who knows how many open on the patio.  no one was waiting in line.  we had a group of 4, but they refused to sit us because we only wanted drinks...they said we could sit at the bar (all the bar stools were taken). i said i ""might"" get an appetizer, but they still wouldnt sit us. we asked when we could get a table for drinks, they said around 11:30 or 12am.  two other larger groups came in at the same time, wanting to just sit and drink, and they wouldn't sit them b/c they weren't ordering food.  those groups left.  my group left and went down the road to mad mex (funny thing is, i actually ended up ordering food).

At first they wanted to charge me 250.00 despite me having an HRA. I told them to call my insurance because my an is not like that. They refused....Accolade called them and not a penny owed. I even got an apology. 

Second imaging was a biopsy that after completed...they threatened to send me to collection. But...my ins said it was going to be covered and then my HRA will kick in. When I asked them to call BCBS they *humf* like I am a nuisance. Then the manager talked down to me telling me they don't need to call...that I am owing it.

I really try to avoid this location or just not get coffee on the weekends since I have to go here but sometimes I just want my Starbucks and give in and it's always such a mess.

Ever been to a juice bar that doesn't have a juicer?  You have now.  Their ""juice"" consists of throwing the ingredients in a blender.  You know, like a smoothie.  

They make smoothies with ingredients that consist of mostly liquid, like watermelon and grapes, and call it juice.  When you ask about it, they give you an explanation that consists of telling you how it is better because you get all the nutrients from the skin and pulp.  If I wanted all of that, I would order a smoothie, because that is a smoothie.  I ordered juice, because I wanted juice.

0,"Went to visit Caswell Station, the first new restaurant/bar in the neighborhood since several closed down over the last year or so. I think it was soft opening, so perhaps they can work out some of the issues we encountered on this first visit. 

It was Sunday Brunch and when we walked in, we were quickly acknowledged (great!). We were at first directed to sit anywhere, but then another server told us she'd take us to a table. There was some clear confusion between the two. We chose to sit at a booth. Unfortunately once we were seated at a booth, we realized how uncomfortable they are. There was about two inches between us and the table, which couldn't move because of the size of the table base. 

We ordered the French toast with bacon and an avocado bacon sandwich with hash browns. The sandwich, which besides the avocado and bacon, had tomato and flavored cream cheese, was very good aside from a little too much cream cheese. The French toast looked nice and was topped with strawberries and whipped cream. Sadly the entire inside was undercooked and fell apart after putting the fork into it. 

The service overall was very lackluster. Our server was very hard to find and seemed to have a chip on her shoulder that AM. We had to flag down a different waitress, who was much more obliging, to let them know about the soggy toast. 

They removed the item from the bill, and the manager was very nice about it. Our waitress only came back by after the manager stopped over and crassly said something about the toast that indicated she didn't know about our issue, even though she should have since she was our server. She also snapped when I asked for more coffee that she was getting it, even though it took a while to come back by with the pot. 

On our way out, we were nicely thanked by two servers sitting at the front, but one was eating a yogurt. Another pet peeve was that the ketchup asked for with the hash browns was served in a plastic to-go container, rather than a bottle or ramekin. 

Don't think we'd run back here anytime soon, even though it's within walking distance and they did a nice job remodeling from when it was Kennedy's.",1,0,-1

0,"I just want to express my feeling about Coach's return policy.  I bought 2 wallets a month ago, never used with tags and original receipt.  I brought back to store today to see if I can return them since I don't think I need them anymore.  But, the store said it has past 30 days and it is their policy not to take any return after 30 days.  First, it was just a few days past.  Most importantly, there is no choice of getting a merchant credit either.  I never had experience with other merchants for the goods that is not marked as ""final sales"" with such a short period for returning unused products with original receipt.  Anyone else has an opinion on this?  I think as a good customer service, you shall at least say ""no return or exchange"" after 30 days on the receipt before you execute the policy this way.  Currently, the policy only say ""you can .... within 30 days"".  That is up to most people's interpretation on what happened after 30 days.  I think  it is not fair to just say there is absolutely no return or exchange for merchant credit after 30 days if you did not say so clearly.  Everyone agree?  Shall I at least get a good customer credit for helping you to correct your ""error"" or ""hole"" on the ""Ts&Cs"" on your receipt? So, there will be no argument or legal dispute.",0,0,-1

1,"To start off with the fact that I had automatic payments set on the loan I got through them and never actually had to pay or ""miss"" a payment physically - they kept posting my payments late and it began when they called me and told me that I owe $74 because I didn't have insurance coverage (mind you I sent them the whole policy which was from August to December with full coverage) and they yet claimed that somehow I did not have insurance coverage from October 21st to November 10th. I don't think that's how insurance policies work and you are somehow magically not covered in the middle of the policy - but nonetheless moving on, I told that I would not pay that $74 and they kept pilling and pilling late payments and kept calling me and I kept explaining the same thing over and over again and my fiancee got involved and it just seemed like it would never be taken care off. So fast forward, many phone calls and going back and forth of how this isn't right and I will not pay what I do not owe, it got racked up to $480ish or something and then I got into a car accident and had the car get totaled. AmFam sent them a check literally 2 weeks after and they were supposed to do the GAP Insurance claim for the rest of the loan. Guess what these intelligent employees do? Ask me for a payment of $174 because I still owe on the loan and they have been posting payments late and reporting it to the credit bureau AGAIN. So yeah.

The twist on the frites (julienned potatoes) was interesting.  The steak however was VERY tough. You know it's tough when the steak knife provided doesn't cut the meat. When I ordered, the server said for an additional $7 I could have a different cut of meat but I assumed at $28 the steak described on the menu would be fine. Perhaps I should have taken that as a caution. The meal came with a small pitcher of Bearnaise  sauce that was so thick it wouldn't pour. When our server checked in to see how our meals were I told her that the steak was very tough and I couldn't cut it. Her response was, ""Really? I'm so sorry"" and then walked away.

No cheese or bacon (that was extra). This was the most expensive burger I had in Canada and I expected this burger to be absolutely fantastic but for the price it was extremely disappointing. The fries was nothing to be excited about either. Due to the cost, I did not want to order anything else. I get you are paying for the location. However, this restaurant is owned by a celebrity chef who has won many awards. You would expect the food to be good even a burger. I have had better burgers at higher end restaurants before and  Dbar's burger did not live up to it's standards.

My biggest beef about this place is that we came here for a mini bridal shower and brought a small cake to share. I did expect the restaurant to charge a fee to bring plates and cutlery. However, they wanted to charge us $10 per person. That is $60 for 6 ladies...Really??? Just to bring plates? Let's just say we did not eat the cake.

Once we ordered our food was brought out sporadically, with toast and main dishes being separated by about 6-8 minutes apart. The food was below average; bacon was overcooked, hash browns were burnt, eggs were cold. Overall a less than satisfactory Sunday brunch. A reasonable price at $9.99 for a decent amount of food. However, the most disappointing part of the entire experience was when our bill came... Our server Emma, decided to stay at the table and hawk eye as I signed for the bill and gave her a tip. This was not only uncomfortable, but also extremely unprofessional and juvenile.

One cashier was dealing with a customer issue, but the remaining 4 were just chit chatting away as if there was no line at all! Taking their sweet time taking off the clothing sensors, folding the clothes ever so slowly, and then stacking them before putting it in the bag with the tissue paper and all. I did not end up purchasing anything from this particular store because of this terrible experience. All in all, If there is even one customer waiting in line, you should kindly move quickly and get to each customer in a respectful amount of time. And as a retail associate, your main concern should be to offer the highest customer service to every customer walking through the doors. Leave all your personal problems at the door, and start work with a blank slate. Come in working with passion and enthusiasm. Act like you want to be there. If it's not something you enjoy then GTFO!",0,0,-1

There was no one to help and even if you request for service, their  demeaning attitude and lack of personality gave the sense of suffocation and one would feel like getting out of the store immediately. Unfortunately, they portray themselves as the wannabe Brook Brothers, but they fail to provide customer service as Brook Brothers .

1,I went here on a Thursday my sister wanted to try a new place I was really looking forward to some sushi they do not have authentic sushi which was very disappointing I order a $27 plate and when I received it . It was very well presented but the quality of the seafood was not what I expected especially paying $27 for a plate I was expecting way more overall it was overpriced for the quality. I have heard it is very nice on the weekends they has a Band playing Live Music but I can't help but think that this is an establishment that thrives off its ambiance instead of the food .

14,"I bought several of these products in the hopes that I would look pretty, but after reading several other reviews and trying the products on my face, I'm furious I have been duped.

I visited this location in March and was approached by a seemingly polite sales associate named Yael, who proceeded to use hard high-pressure sales tactics. Do not go in here if you have a trigger finger on your credit card and here's why.

Before you buy, look at the typical prices from their website, then compare it to the price they will give you. The products' prices will not be listed on the products themselves or anywhere on the display counter. I wonder why...?!?!:

Essence Facial Detoxifying Cleansing Cream: $99.95
Essence Facial Peeling Gel: $189.00
Essence Facial Serum: $749.95

At the very least, it is cheaply made substitute for other popular beauty ""serum"" and creams. I saw their high-pressure sales tactics to unbeknownst victims suckered by their methods: isolate the customer, compliment their face and skin, sample only one side of the face to prove how much effect the cream has, do not show any prices, compare the prices to their own online retail and show how exorbitant it is and give them a better price in-store, walk back and forth from the computer to make it look like you are checking inventory and prices, claim that since the manager is not there that the salesperson will give a super discount, give a combo package, throw in an extra gift. All this for $600+ bottle of cream?!

Last but not least, their refund policy: NO REFUNDS. They will intentionally NOT itemize items on the receipt to show how much of a discount you are getting and print at the very bottom of the receipt NO REFUNDS. They trick you if you are unsuspecting and force you into a position which you cannot correct.

If you are reading this and you were scammed, send this post and your personal evidence to the Nevada Bureau of Consumer Protection and cite ""NRS Chapter 598 Deceptive Trade Practices"", emai/calll your complaint to Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood.

Their customer service numbers do not work, last time I called I ended up with hang-ups or automated response of invalid number. As this is the first review, I'm unsure why that is. Please review the links above. Do not go into this store.",1,1,-1
0,"""Meh"" is the best word to describe this restaurant. Having a good experience there is extremely hit or miss. I've been often enough because it's within walking distance of my house, but I'm sick of giving them my money. Service is slow, even when the place is empty, and most of the meals suffer from a lack of proper seasoning. This is a shame, because they do use quality ingredients, and the location/ambiance of the place is nice. The kale salad is *decent*, as is the veggie burger. Everything else I've ever ordered has been bland, uninspired, and not worth the money. A friend and I ate there today. I realized halfway through the meal that the kitchen staff forgot to put the cashews in my salad that are listed on the menu. The place was nearly empty and our server didn't bother to check on us after serving our meals until we were nearly finished eating. At that point, it wasn't worth my time/energy to complain so we paid and left. My friend and I both agreed that it'd be a waste of appetite and money to return. Good riddance. I'd like to see another veg place move into Plaza-Midwood and give these guys some competition. They need it.",0,0,-1

I am 25 years old with an amazing paying job due to my education. I had to buy confetti for a baby gender reveal today. It was $4.72. THATS IT. But I was judged the second I walked in and I was asked to give them my backpack. Then one employee told me I could even ask the corporate manager who was there. Which was actually just the store manager. They have NO signs posted saying that they don't allow outside bags in. It happened to feel good outside so I decided to ride my motorcycle which is why I had my backpack with me. But to be judged for being young and pretty much accused of being a thief or looking like a thief. I show everyone respect even when I don't know them.

1,"This place has been on a downward spiral for 5 years now. When I first discovered this place I was in love. That was because I was a naive sushi newbie and the restaurant was upholding higher standards back then. Over time, and with a change in ownership, the quality of this sushi has gone extremely downhill. The sashimi is often still frozen and thawing on your plate (gross), the fish is not cut well and often still joined together instead of in separate pieces, rolls have way too much rice, are loosely wrapped and have terrible cuts of fish and too much 'filler' (cucumber, avocado). 
Overall, if you are just learning about sushi, give it a shot but if you're accustomed to your better sushi places, it's sure to disappoint.
Now, let's talk service...or shall I say lack of service. The issue here is largely one of language. Most of their servers barely speak English so if you have a question or request-good luck!
I will say that the decor is quite nice, especially given their makeover a couple of years ago.
Given that I live in this neighborhood, I am very disappointed as a great sushi resto would be amazing to have alongside the Greek places but 'Sushi D' (as it's known to locals) just doesn't meet basic expectations anymore. :(",0,1,-1

16,"I've stayed at the Cosmo a couple times since they opened - both great experiences! However, this past stay over Super Bowl weekend was an absolute disappointment! 

Check-in was very easy and pleasant. I gave the gentleman at the front desk the  name of a person that will be staying in the room (arriving later in the evening) - no problems. 

We arrived at the room only to be immediately greeted by a pungent smell of smoke. I called and spoke to a manager about it.  Instead of moving us to another room, he asked me to provide him with a convenient time for his staff to bring in an ""ozone machine"" to deodorize the space. I was speechless.

I then go to use the bathroom, only to realize that we had NO trash cans in the ENTIRE room.  I called again. They assured me that someone was on their way to deliver new cans. We went out to grab food and gamble (2-3 hours). Arrived back - still no trash cans. Again, I called the front desk, they assured me they were on their way. 30 min later there was a knock on my door. 

We then head out to dinner. Our friend arrives at the hotel while we are out. He gives the front desk both his and my name. They give him the room key - no problems there. He then gets to the room, unpacks, showers, shaves, grabs a drink from the mini bar and takes off to meet us at the casino. Long story short...About 2 hrs later we figure out that the front desk had given him the wrong room key (directed him to the wrong room). All this time he was showering and settling in to a room that wasn't his - luckily the owners of the room hadn't returned since he had arrived. We immediately went to speak to the front desk about this - they lightheartedly apologized (as if it was funny). Not the reaction I was expecting. They brought over another gentleman who claimed to be a ""manager,"" all he did was briefly apologize. He did not seem too interested in making sure we were satisfied. 

btw...all of this happened on my girlfriend's bday weekend. 

I expected much more from this hotel. Its as if my business didn't matter to them. Most likely won't go back in the near future.",5,1,-1

However, this store had the worst selection ever. 7 styles of slim fit suits. That is it, 7 styles. Sure they are cheap, if you spend 300 dollars! You are not allowed to purchase 1 suit for 150, you can only purchase 2 suits for 300 dollars. Just feeling the materials and examining the construction tells me that these suits are as low quality as they come. You get what you pay for. Save your money, you would be better off getting 1 suit for 300 dollars from places like Zara, le chateau and Mexx. At least the construction there will be somewhat passable as a nice suit if the fit is right. No matter how you sport these suits sold in this store, you will come off looking cheap.",0,0,-1

I didn't pay money for his opinions about me. After that, we ate and the food was okay. The same actor came up to me later and told me to dance more and asked me who I had to impress. Excuse me. Then later, he made me and my sister get up for the boquet toss (I mean, what if you don't want to participate?). We had a fake-drunk actor at my table, how random.

A few weeks back I had to smash my window in my house because I locked my keys in my car.(this was a tuesday)  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to make a flight within an hour I would have called a locksmith.  Long story short, I made arrangements with several companies to come and do a estimate for window replacement.  They all informed me that there would be a 3-5 day wait for the window replacement.  I called True View Windows and they informed me that I would have same day service to include glass replacement.  WOW!  I canceled all the other companies that were scheduled come out.  
The next day (wed) I had a technician come to my house to measure the window, he informed me that it would have to be custom made.  So, obviously same day service was NOT an option. He told me 3-5 days.  While he was there I had him measure my windows for screens, I thought I was going to have it done anyways, why not kill two birds with one stone.  Jeff, the technician was very professional and friendly.  He measure all my windows and gave me samples of screening to play with.  We were talking about the 80% and 90% screens.  He informed me there would be no difference in the price if I chose either.  So, he did the measurements same day.  Again he was very professional and friendly.  
The next day (Thursday) I got a call from TRUE VIEW.  Got the time frame (3-5) business days for windows and an estimate for screens.  Screens were really highly priced 3 little block windows 12""12"" (approx 1 sq ft each)  were going to be over $350.  In addition to that they told me there was a difference in the price for 80% to 90%.  
I called on friday to get an idea of when my window was going to be ready.  When I called the woman told me 7-10 business days.  I had already left a deposit with the initial order.  I couldn't believe it.  I was hoping that window would be ready for installation for the following TUE- WED, I had cleared those two days.What happned to 3-5 business days? Well, those days weren't an option either.  Friday was the only day it could be done.  I told them I had a 5pm flight to catch on friday and if I could have an early morning appt.  They said it wasn't possible because the TECH has another apt that day.  Do they only have 1 technician?   My suggestion is get estimates and use another company.

Like Gabi's friend, I too, used to frequent and even work at one of these establishments. I have experienced situations that brought to light the owner's mentality when it comes to suffocating out any potential mom & pop competition, just like the Big Box Stores. 

If you have a choice, you will be better off sticking with a more indie smoke shop instead of Trails. 

Trails is the older flunky burnout kid who didn't graduate from high school yet; always bullying the younger, smaller kids while acting like a big baby himself. 

And the poor employees get brainwashed into thinking that the few bucks per hour carrot they are getting dangled in front of them is so very worth being able to keep their freaky hairstyle and piercings while at work. 

Interesting bit o' trivia: 

Arizona is one of the more lenient states towards the sale of items with 'multiple uses' , where some of the uses may and some may not be legal. The main reason for this leniency is because Trail's owner's father was a state politician at one time and helped make sure the laws stayed favorable to his son's lucrative business!",4,6,-1

When I pointed out and showed the manager the problem with hair in the food he shrugged and walked away.  We will NEVER eat here again.  Really opened my eyes to issues with other buffets.,0,0,-1
20,"If you want to pay good money to be amused by the way she CAN accurately describe the people in your life, go for it.  But, as far as accuracy for me, she was WAY off mark.  For one, I asked about my mother who had breast cancer (I was estranged from her and wondering if I should go see her).  Carrie told me she would be dead within two months.  Nope.  About four months later, and with her treatment over, she's alive and considered cured.  I think it's cruel to say that to someone.  Also, I asked her about three dogs I rescued,  who disappeared while with a foster I trusted to help me  (with them).  she said they were all either dead or in horrible conditions (she just LOVED giving me good news, apparently).  I was disturbed after her reading.  So I called a psychic (who charges  much less) who I've used for about ten years now.  She said (without my even mentioning that my mother had breast cancer, only that she wasn't well) that my mother would live and be fine, she'd just have a difference in her chest area (how's that for accuracy?).  She also said that my three rescue dogs had been adopted out and were now okay.  I also called a pet psychic I had used who I knew was accurate.  She also said they were all alive.",6,4,-1

1,"Extremely disappointed by the service and the management. We were there with a party of 18 for a birthday celebration and two veterans on Veterans Day. We sat for an hour and 30 minutes before we got drinks. What a joke! When I approached the manager he said he would see what was going on. Shortly after the chefs arrived to prepare our meal. I thought things were course corrected.  But then... We never got our soup and when asked about it the staff said sorry- we will take care of it. They never did. When we finished our meal we sat for 45 mins waiting for the birthday celebration. I had to find the manager again to find out what was going on. Again... he said he'd figure it out...but then We literally had a server and another staff member come to a table of 18 to sing. Pathetic!! Of course - another 20 mins for a check. As we were walking out there was another table with a birthday celebration. They had 5 staff members and the coward restaurant manager singing for them. As we left the restaurant I waited for the manager at the front..his response to the poor service - NOTHING! Not a word. 100% lack of accountability!!! $1000 check and not even an ""I'm sorry""! Inexcusable!!! Save yourself the disappointment... don't drop a dine in this establishment. Btw- during all of this I made two trips to the bar to get drinks for the whole table when we had a server!!! Yes - I am a former food server. I know what is acceptable and what is inexcusable.

My friend and I went for food early Sunday morning, 4/8/18 and were directed by someone named Brian with a shirt that said ""officer"" and identified himself as such who told us to park in the abandoned lot next door( I was later informed by an official officer that he is NOT an officer but a security guard).  After about 15 minutes we returned to find my car with an illegal boot (chains around my tire) with 3 men demanding (screaming, yelling & cursing)  we pay $150 cash or $180 credit to release the vehicle. It is illegal to boot or tow cars for a lot that they do not have a contract for. It is clear that Brian and this ""scamming booting company"" were working together.

4,"DO NOT GO HERE.  I live near by and entrusted my car at this shop several times. I received my inspection here, several tire changes and breaks. Most recently,  I took my car in for jerking and for a loud scraping noise coming from the rear tires. They suggested an alignment and two (used) tires. This did not fix the jerking of my car or the terrible sound. They said to return in 3 weeks to replace the upper tire arm. Less than 24 hours later, I was driving and the car jerked out of the lanes and I had to pull into any car shop because I knew my car was unsafe to drive. The rear left tire was tilted. The wheel bearing had come apart and the rotors were damaged. The shop owner said once he lifted my car, the tire would surely fall off. 

My car has been serviced by Depo Tires & Services for months and I have spent hundreds of dollars expecting proper and honest work. They improperly installed my breaks, and charged me $120 for an alignment and tires that did not fix the issue for which I came in for (car jerking uncontrollably). My car had to sit at that shop on the side of the road for a week because I could not afford to pay $600+ for a new wheel bearing, rotors, and breaks. Depo Tires & Services neglected to inform me that my car was not safe to drive. 

Once I was able to request an advance from my boss in order to pay for the repairs, I went back to Depo Tires & Services to inform them of the improper work, how they put my safety at risk by allowing me to leave with the car Friday afternoon only for the wheel to completely fall apart Saturday morning. My breaks are under warranty but since they had been replaced by the shop that rescued me, there was nothing (Depo) they could do for me. When I asked to speak to the owner, any employee laughed saying he's never here. I insisted they risked my safety, I was a loyal and paying customer, I need to be compensated for their negligence, poor work, and damages to my car due to their ignorance.  The person who spoke to me was unprofessional, defensive, and apathetic to my needs as a customer and his role in effectively serving customers.

I would never let anyone I know take their car to this place. If you want to pay money for repairs, parts, and or service on your car, ask the manager of the technical dept at your place of work for the contact information of whoever services his/her vehicle. I would also suggest going to a chain or more established company with a reliable customer service dept. I would rather pay a little more money at a reputable car service shop for efficient work backed by warm customer service than to every end up at this place on South Blvd again.

They get the job done and they deliver without a min requirement for a fee of $6.50 so I will keep them on standby if I have a craving for lemon pepper, dont feel like driving or Ubering, and dont have my own ranch in the 'fridge. 


DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON SERVICE ONLY

I am a lemon pepper connoisseur (check my previous reviews) so I was excited to give this place a try based on others recommendations But!

I started my order online and saw a charge for ranch so before checking out I called and asked if this was for the 1st side of ranch or additional sides of ranch. The girl who answered flippantly told me it was for the 1st order in a ""take it or leave it"" tone. 

I'll leave it. Because lemon pepper wings arent hard to find and I am tired of businesses acting like I owe them my money and competitors aren't right around the corner. A side or ranch or blue cheese comes with wings. I understand paying for extra but yall are not about to start charging for the 1st one. Pretty soon they eill start charging for the sauce on the wings. Wingstop or ATL Wings, I am on my way.

Couture vintage or not. $900 dollars for a vinyl purse is way to much. See, one of the draw backs of vintage clothing is that it is far more fragile than a new piece even if it is in good condition because things tend to dry out over the years. That being said, a vintage couture piece should not cost more than a contemporary couture piece. I would have been happy to pay $2-300 for a vintage couture piece and can do through etsy or ebay or a local Seattle vintage shop for even less. But good lord not $1000. Sorry Annie Cream cheese.

6,"This is a very tough review for me to write. On our trip to Pyaar the one good thing I can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet. Unfortunately, I really didn't like my meal here.

It should also be noted that this is a review ONLY of the dinner buffet - it's possible that ala carte menu ordering will produce a different experience.

Anyway, when my wife and I discovered a new Indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased, but the news that this one would feature an Indian DINNER buffet had us over the moon. We are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we aren't always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet - the chance of a dinner option for Indian buffet sounded perfect.

Tonight we went in with no expectations. $9.99 or so per person for dinner seemed like a good deal, although we were surprised that Naan had to be purchased separately (it's usually included with the buffet - this is the first time i've seen it as an extra).

The selection was small and I ran into immediate problems. I'm not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine Pyaar aims at - they claim to me ""The only North-South-Mogul Indian restaurant in Vegas"" - but I was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes, the lack of any real ""main"" dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces I've come to expect from Indian food. 

No Paneer dish, no Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhani, no samosas, no pakora, no kofta of any sort.  What I ended up with was the only two tandoori chicken drumsticks, some of the very wet ""chilli beef"" some of the vegetable curry and a lot of rice.

The tandoori chicken was fine if unspectacular and I'd have been OK to eat that and write it off as a ""notch in the belt"" but not somewhere I wanted to visit again, but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which I don't like. The chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added, potatoes were OK-ish but a bit hard in the vegetable curry.

My vegetarian wife fared even worse than me - ending up with some chick peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati rice.

By the time our Naan (which tasted like a flour tortilla) arrived I realised that I had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies I have come to associate with Indian food.

Around 3 minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check. The owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice, offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the Naan. 

Now, perhaps it's a different type of Indian cuisine and it's just our personal taste, but we really didn't like the buffet here at all. I feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because I really liked the owners, but I hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now it's uninspired bordering on inedible.",1,0,-1

The service was not that great. Although we had a large group our server didn't notice new additions to the group.

Turkey breast, beef, gravy and cranberries were in the middle. The lines over lapped with people who had come from the Chinese food line up, got turkey/gravy in the middle and then barged into the turkey fixing line up head-on. It was a serious cluster-fck. The turkey breasts were moist but the beef was tough and over done. The cooked veggie sides were so overcooked they were grey and mushy. The desserts though were a-ok. There was plenty of pumpkin pie, a chocolate fountain and many cookies, squares and chocolates. I think I ate more dessert than hot food. But I'm not sure I got $22.50 worth of food.

Strangely they would not let us pay for our dinners separately, insisting it be one tab for food but they would allow us to pay our beverages separately. Because of the food tab, some folks had to go into the casino to use the ATM to pay cash for their portion.

Parking was not an issue. We walked from the back of the lot, but there were plenty of spots available when we arrived.

I can't see myself going back there for the buffet again. It was fine but not great.",2,0,-1

WAY overcrowded and by the ""standards"" of the instructors they want to cram more people in there.  Just looking at the Google reviews and yelp reviews it's obvious that they overbook classes, they don't even have adequate parking!  Half the time I have to park off property in the dirt on the back road behind the studio.  Do you want to know how gross it is?

1.  Extend your arms and drip sweat on your neighbor's mat!

2. I hope you like everyone's funk, sweating in their personal space for 1 hour. I used to go to ANY OTHER YOGA STUDIO and never had this problem.  They all have the common sense not to overbook their classes like this studio.

3. Now face towards the side wall and bend over without sticking your head up your neighbor's sweaty !@#@!

4. Awkward moments of sweat flying off your neighbor hitting you in the face and vice versa.  If they didn't pack customers in like sardines this wouldn't be a problem.

5.  Book your class online, too bad the website doesn't work, even if you RESERVE your class online you ARE NOT RESERVED a spot,  they don't even honor the sign in so why even bother signing in?

6. Don't trust the fraudulent free tour, come on a Sunday evening or Friday and try finding a spot.  DO NOT PAY FOR A YEAR, try it for 1 day, 1 week etc, go on a Sunday night or a friday night.

7.  Bathrooms are gross and low end compared to other hot yoga studios.  Really bottom of the barrel when it comes to the lockers and bathroom.  Just check out that recent picture of the broken toilet.

8.  This is like the budget value motel 6 of hot yoga, you don't want to step on the floor barefoot.

9. To be honest, most of the instructors are pretty amazing, the staff was nice, but the arrogant owner has no common sense, maybe he was raised by a pack of wild dogs or something, how do you not realize that people don't like rolling around everyone's community pool of fluids?

My party (2 adults and a child) arrived at 12 PM today and requested to sit outside. We were greeted promptly with water and flatware. During that visit, I requested a kids apple juice. It took more than 10 minutes for the juice to be brought out. Then, our server (whose name I don't even know) took 50 minutes to bring out our entrees. There were parties sat after us who received food before us. I know that some orders may take less time to prepare but 50 minutes was ridiculous. The server had definitely forgotten about our order. He then was quite prompt to process a payment.

Latest experience was this weekend. Check-in time was what, 3pm? We arrived at 7pm due to our flight. They gave away our 2-bed room and left us with a 1-bed room that smelled like straight up WEED. No apologies and no discounts. Are you freaking serious? It honestly felt like a huge slap in the face. 

Another thing is the fridge. Why can't they reserve the top row for the weighted/censored items and the bottom row for people to put in their own food and beverages? Or have two separate fridges? Ridiculous!

She points to the sign and yes there are new signs with a price increase. Okay, no problem, whatever. I tell her that for almost $6 I would rather have the carne asada burrito. Nobody was doing anything at that point (cooks) and she just looked at me for a second and said ya. YA?? What is that all about? Whatever at this point. So I get my food and it is by far the worst tacos I have ever had there in over two years. Nothing in them and extra greasy crap dripping all over.

I simply called the first 10 places that popped up on my google search and booked with them because they gave me the BEST quote for what I wanted which was a deep clean of my sofa . I never give bad reviews because I don't like to do that to business but this was completely unprofessional and wrong to scam people with prices that are incorrect just to get your business. The woman who quoted me over the phone asked all the question that are standard to giving a quote such as is there any stains , the type of fabric etc. I explained thoroughly what I wanted done and was quoted $49 which I was shocked because that's half the price everywhere else. Come to the actual appointment it's actually $99 for shampoo and steam clean . Apparently that quote was for ""steam"" only not shampoo . And scotch guard was going to be an additional $50 . So from a $49 quote it is now $150 . Completely felt scammed. I specifically told the woman on the phone I wanted my sofa deep cleaned and scotch guarded. Don't know what that means to anyone else in the world but to me that means shampoo , not ""steam "" If it wasn't for the fact that the technician that came to my home was so polite and nice , I wouldn't of had them do it.

Bought a new KItchenAid $1200 dishwasher. Paid Spencer's to install it. Installer had to read manual while sitting in my home to understand how to install it (gotta be kidding me!). 

It didn't work after being installed!!! (installer didn't stay to check if worked properly). 

Called to speak with Manager (Wayne) who said Spencer's would only REPAIR IT and not allow me to return it OR even send me out a new one. Unbelievable to me that I am repairing my $1200 KitchenAid dishwasher before it has even run one full cycle!!! Someone should have stayed or at least called me a few hours later to make sure it works properly. And if it's broken, replace it or give me a refund... 

A service tech (not the original installer) came out a few days later to inspect the dishwasher and he said it was broken and needed parts. Would take days to get those in... 

Called Wayne again and he said this is ""HOW THE APPLIANCE BUSINESS WORKS"" when I asked him about repairing it instead of replacing it or giving me my money back. Wayne promised to call me Tuesday after repairs were made and, of course, he never called. 

After multiple service attempts and my wife having to be at home from ""8 to noon"" multiple days to accommodate service repair techs, and after 2 weeks without a working dishwasher, it was evident that the dishwasher was bad and Spencer's was forced by KitchenAid to replace the dishwasher. Wayne should have offered to replace it to begin with! 

As for Wayne's statement about ""this is how the appliance business works"", I called 4 competitors to see what they would do in my scenario: 
COSTCO - return to store within 90 days for FULL REFUND 
BEST BUY - return to store within 15 days for FULL REFUND 
HOME DEPOT - return to store within 48 hrs for NEW PRODUCT or FULL REFUND 
SEARS - return to store within 60 days for NEW PRODUCT of FULL REFUND 

Spencer's wouldn't even stand by their product for 2 hours, let alone days/weeks like the above merchants would. They basically just sold me a faulty dishwasher, installed it for $150 and then washed their hands of it without even making sure it worked once! Then left me dealing with the KitchenAid 1 year manufacturer's warranty to try to fix it. Spencer's never even followed up once to see if the overall issue had been resolved.

7,"What is it with Arizona and their obsession with California chains?  It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.  

The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.  

I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.  

The only thing ""habit"" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.  

Hit up Lobby's a mile or so north for a big, juicy, flavorful burger  that is locally owned and blows away this less than stellar chain from CA.  The most disappointing thing is the landlord kicked out TOTTs for a run of the mill burger chain.",3,3,-1

This company has heard my complaints & I have been in 5 different times. When I have asked Dr. Steinway ""what is causing these UTI's?"" He responded with ""I do not know"". My husband is in medical school & my father is a doctor. I have always had respect for medical professionals but after crying in patient rooms & complaining, i got an ""i don't know"" answer. I had to quit my job because of how much work I have missed. I was just another paying costumer rather than a young girl who has pain daily.

1,"Came to the Wicked Spoon after seeing delicious looking delicacies and desserts not often found in a buffet in pictures on Yelp. It touts itself as an upscale buffet located in the ritzy Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. The only thing upscale about this place was the price ($38 per person). The food was OK, but not really worth the price we paid, considering this is supposed to be upscale. The mac and cheese bar was ""meh"", the Asian section was lacking, and the gnocchi was not cooked properly. Not what I am expecting from a $80+ bill at the Cosmo. The place at least looked nice, though. Save some money and go to the Rio and have the Carnival Buffet instead.",1,1,-1

If you aren't wanting a mixed drink or craft beer, their specialty cocktails will knock your socks off. The food is usually pretty good too. This past time I was there, I was very let down. Service was absolutely horrific. We wished we could have tipped the hostess instead of our server. It wasn't very busy and yet our server  barely gave us any attention. She took our drink order and an order for an appetizer. We didn't see her again for almost 15 minutes. We tried waving her down but that didn't help. The hostess came over and took our order for us. I had ordered my burger to be cooked medium and it came out well done. We could have said something except our server only came by to give us our checks.

0,"I purchased a pair of nice Oxfords for an upcoming occasion. Uncertain about the style of the shoe, Jason, my sales associate, recommended I take the shoes home and pair them with my outfit. If I liked them, keep them. If I didn't, bring them back - no harm no foul.

So, that's what I did. I tried them on at home and wasn't completely sold on the style. I waited until after the weekend to return the shoes.

Upon trying to return the shoes, I think everything is going great. Right? Wrong. The associate at the customer services desk tells me they can't be returned because a section of the sole had been scratched on the edge. Not the entire sole, just the edge of the sole (a decent pair of dress shoes has a very soft sole all around). I tried to explain, but they pretty much told me there was nothing they could do, and it was my problem. I listened to the shoes salesman, and now I'm paying for it. 

Long story short, after speaking with another associate, and then the manager, I'm back home with a pair of shoes I don't even want. Their final words of wisdom? Sell the shoes on Craigslist.",0,0,-1
1,"I hate to give out; 

The optometrist Sophia and the rest of the staff were very friendly, knowledgeable on time with my appointment, and my glasses were as I ordered. That's about are my positives.  My exam was over within 30 minutes. 

I needed a routine eye exam; I hadn't received one in several years. I have single vision. I was planning to buy my eyeglasses online like I've purchased my last 8-10 pairs over the past 6 years (They are remarkably cheaper online). 

As I was about to leave the optician's chair, I asked for my pupillary distance (PD) on my prescription. This is needed to measure the distance between your pupils and is not always included on your typical prescription. With your PD and rx, you buy your eyeglasses at any retailer. Opticians don't always include it but several states (Massachusetts do require opticians to include in your prescription. 
Sophia, my optician, calmly said, oh I think there's a small fee for it, but I don't know, ask the front desk. 

So, I did. They charge $40 to measure my PD if I didn't buy my glasses from here. FOH. I should have walked out right then (in the end my PD ended up being exactly the same than when I measured it myself a few years ago!). 

I have insurance now which gives me $130 to spend on frames, so I hastily thought, it wouldn't much more than it would be online. Let me look around. Without insurance, their cheapest frames are $150 (that does not include the lenses). 

Despite my insurance, I ended up paying ~$100 more than I typically spend online even with cheaper lenses (I didn't get progressives that change in sunlight, no extra coatings, etc).  

I was the only customer here at the time of my visit so the assistant doted on me with full attention as I tried pairs on. The personal service was good. I could try on pairs in store, see how they looked in a mirror, feel how they'd sit on my face.
But the pricing..oof. 

I felt like a sucker, honestly. 

I had hoped that since I'm order locally, I'd be able to receive them quicker than if I would purchase them online. Nope; they had to send them away and it would take 2 weeks to receive them (same amount of time that it usually takes for regular shipping if you order online through zenni or eyebuydirect). 

If you want to support your local business, want to try on frames before purchasing them, go right ahead and stop by here, they're friendly. 
I didn't find it worth it and felt it's a bit disingenuous to charge for the PD. Next time, I'll buy online, save money, and spend the money I saved on other local businesses.",0,0,-1

16,"This big, glitzy facility housing all of the major and minor car rental companies is a 1 stop shop for renting a car at PHX. That sounds like it should be great but its comprehensive largesse cannot overcome several shortcomings that are a little aggravating from the customer side of things: 

1. It is off site. Way off site. It is several miles away and at a minimum it is a 10 minute shuttle ride IF there is no traffic. That is a big ""if"" because PHX is a busy airport so it is typically fairly congested. I travel a lot for business so the last thing I want to do is get off a plane only to sit on a shuttle in traffic to get to my rental car. As an example, on my last trip I timed it from the point I stepped off the airplane to when I cleared the rental car company security check out: 56 minutes! (and I am a top elite renter with 1 agency so I get all the short cuts like bypassing the counter and jumping in any car on the lot and simply driving it away!)  I know that sounds arrogant like I am too important to waste 56 minutes but that really misses the point which is one of convenience and efficiency. 

2. The shuttles tend to be packed. I get it, their job is to move a lot of people to the car rental center. So they don't leave the terminal until they are full. Sometimes overfull. This creates a process where they wait at the terminal curb for more and more people to show up (further delaying you from getting on with your car rental) and then they start creatively jamming more people and luggage onto the shuttle. By the time you pull away from the curb, if you are not handicapped, elderly, legless, or pregnant, you will be standing jammed in shoulder to shoulder with a lot of people. Arrive on a hot day (every day in PHX) and it becomes apparent pretty quickly who's deodorant has failed. 

3. The traffic that the shuttle has to navigate is tremendous on the way to the Car Rental Center. It may be that PHX is currently undergoing some construction in areas so that is making it more congested but the reality is that it is still part of the process to get on a shuttle and wait in traffic to get to the center several miles away. 

4. The reverse of all of this is in effect when you return your car and need to catch your plane. Be forewarned, leave a large time buffer if you need to return a car. I have flown almost 3 million miles in my career all over the world and rented cars in many places. I have only missed 1 flight ever in my life and it was at PHX because the traffic and car return process was so lengthy. 

This car rental center is a necessary evil for me but as you can tell, I'm not a fan.",5,5,-1

Because we werent 100% sure that it was Martoranos that made us sick, but low and behold after the 4 of us went to dinner EVERYONE had horrible issues with their digestive system. I dont know if the food was spoiled or if they just over did it on the grease but we never plan on returning there. It tasted great but the after affects were not worth it.

Our evening started poorly when we arrived around 7 on a quiet Tuesady night to a 1/3 full restaurant. The server made it seem that because we didn't have a reservation she was making a grand gesture to us by fitting us in for a table for two.
The next server who came to our table made it very clear that he knew everything about wine and we knew nothing. I always appreciate it when I am lectured by a server 15 years my junior. We had some confusion regarding the hot balls we ordered, and we treated as if we were idiots for not understanding something the server said. Sadly, our food was good.. I had the steak frites, the meat was quite good.  The final straw was when the server mocked me for ordering ketchup with my steak frites.

It's a pay-first-and-order-first-before-you-sit- then- have-your-food-delivered  style restaurant. The food is mediocre. The breakfast burrito that I ordered, I could have made at home with better ingredients and garnishes. They did not even provide us with a spoon to stir our coffees. We had to use a knife to do that.

Love this local (mostly) Chinese food place for its takeout. Lunch specials are good for dishes like General Tsao's Chicken and Broccoli Beef, and they come with a  choice of egg roll or soup.

5,"I had been wanting to try Republic for months, especially since I had a Groupon! When we walked through the door on a Friday night, I really wanted to like Republic. The decor is modern Irish Pub, the walls are white washed brick and I really loved the atmosphere. 

Our waiter greeted us and he seemed nice enough, until we asked if he had any recommendations from the menu. He started to walk away after we asked if there was anything he would recommend, then he explained that they do comfort food...ok? I guess...so we ordered and when the plates came out they were clean and everything looked good.

My husband had the fried chicken, it was cooked perfectly but the batter was bland, even a little salt would have spiced it up. The chicken came with 2 buttermilk biscuits, but no butter. The biscuits were dry and definitely needed some butter. I ordered the short ribs with wasabi mashed potatoes. The ribs were cooked perfectly, but again lacked flavor. I mean they should have been cooked in some sort of spice! The wasabi in the mashed potatoes was overpowering and didn't seem to fit the dish. I barely touched my meal but our waiter said nothing. He brought me a to-go box but didn't even put my meal in the box for me. Ok I can do it, but he seemed to be avoiding the fact that I didn't eat my meal. He never once asked how our food was during the meal. 

Then he brought the check...now I had already told him about our Groupon, which he waved off as no big deal, but of course the discount was not on the check. I reminded him again and when I pulled out my iphone to show him the code, he got really huffy. He asked why I didn't print out the Groupon, well because I am not required to, welcome to the 21st century. He took our check and then the manager (I think it may have been the owner) came over. He asked about the Groupon and was very friendly. He asked about our experience and we explained the lack of flavor and the poor service. He explained that our waiter was a little older and may not have understood the new technology. This seemed like a poor excuse, if your business is taking part in a promotion your waitstaff should know the ins and outs of the deal. Needless to say, I went across the street to Firehouse Subs for dinner. Bad service and flavorless food, shame on you Republic.",0,2,-1

6,"I contacted Julie to see if she would be able and willing to do some work on a suit that I needed for a very important interview I had coming up (date and time unknown at this point). I was looking to get the pants hemmed up a few inches, my sleeves shortened, and some alterations made to the shoulders to prevent them from protruding out too far. She agreed over the phone that it would be no problem, and I met up with her at her place in order for her to take my measurements. She explained her pricing (very fair) and that her average turn-around time was one week. This was on Monday morning.

On Monday afternoon, I received the call from my interviewer saying my interview would be held on the following Tuesday at 7:00am. I immediately called Julie and left her a message saying that I would definitely need my suit by that Tuesday at 7:00am. Based on her previously quoted week turn around time, I didn't imagine this would be a problem but I understood it might still be a tight crunch, and that's why I called to let her know.

On Thursday of that week, I called her again just to check and make sure everything was OK and on schedule. Again she promised that everything was fine and it was all going to be OK and that she would ""definitely have it ready by [my] interview.""

The following Monday at 11:42am, I received the text message: ""Hello Eric... I have completed your pants and 1 sleeve... have to get ready for work now but I will finish this for you I promise... it will be ready for you for your interview for tomorrow."" I texted her back and asked if she had any idea of when it might be ready, but I didn't hear back from her. 

So, at 10:30pm that night I called and spoke to her. She said she hadn't started working on it yet as she just got off from work and she informed me that she had also decided not to do any alterations to the shoulders like we had originally agreed on because she already shortened one of the sleeves the full length and if she made any further alterations to the shoulder the whole sleeve would come out too short, and she didn't want to bother with having to undo the sleeve hem she already made thereby having to start over. Seems to me that if the sleeve length is, say, 2 inches too long and you have to take the shoulders in  1/2 inch, you'd only alter the sleeves 1.5 inches to allow for that extra half inch at the top (""Alterations 101,"" right?). Instead, she offered to finish shortening the second sleeve and call it a night and said I could bring it back to her at a future date and she'd do the shoulders for free. I reminded her I needed it for an extremely important interview in a matter of 8 and a half hours. Much to her annoyance, she said if I was willing to wait longer into the night, she'd go ahead and undo the first sleeve, redo them, and alter the shoulders like I had originally requested.

At 12:44am I got the following text message: ""Ok so I truly don't think the shoulders will be done... I finished everything else but the shoulders are a bit complicated once I got in there... so sorry. Anyways I am done so we can meet somewhere half way."" She gave up and declared her work ""done,"" without having followed through with what she said she would.

Around 1:30am my wife picked up the suit from her and paid her. She made it home around 1:45am. The pants hem was fine, although the pants themselves were horribly wrinkled and creased. We never agreed that she would iron or press them, so I wasn't expecting differently, though the extra touch would have been appreciated especially considering the following, additional shortcomings:

The sleeves were altered terribly. The stitching was very sloppy--loose and very uneven with lots of free-hanging loops and zig/zag clusters. One of the sleeves had a large cut in it at the end that rolled from the outside onto the inside. I can't tell if she snipped it with a pair of scissors after it was altered or if she gashed it first and then continued to go about sewing it up and allowing it to show on the outside. Either way, ""Alterations 101"" fail again. If it weren't for the dark, late night parking lot pickup we might have noticed this before we paid her and probably would have only paid for the pants.

I have included a screen shot of the text messages we shared and pictures of the terrible stitching and damage--I sincerely hope Yelp lets them stay up. If they aren't there, feel free to contact me and I'll be glad to send them to you. Cannot recommend her any less. She makes all the promises in the world but lacks any of the ability, skill, or motivation to complete them. Look elsewhere.",0,0,-1

The pesto pasta was ok, but still very plain & made with regular noodles. The other 2 meals were plain as well & made with white rice. This blows my mind. The meals are supposed to be healthy but they are filled with all of these empty calories. Also, none of the rice was even cooked completely. Super disappointing & a waste of money.",0,2,-1

15,"**The comment by 24 hour fitness staff on this review was kind but the staff member failed to follow through. I haven't heard back from him or anyone at 24 hour fitness (but I have received numerous annoying text message and phone call marketing contacts).***

I was really disappointed with my experience at this particular 24 Hour Fitness Location this afternoon. When I arrived I was greeted by smiling faces at the front counter and I informed them that I had filled out their FREE 3-Day Pass online. The associates guided me to a computer screen when I answered a few questions and entered in my information. A second associate then approached me and said she was going to give me a tour. I said okay great! I followed her around as she showed me the different parts of the gym and overall it was a pleasant experience....until we walked in to their sales area where she told me they had a special on family memberships (I had told her I was meeting a friend who had a membership there to play some basketball). I himmed and hawwed for a minute and said no thanks I'm not interested in a membership RIGHT THIS SECOND (mind you...I walked in the door about 2 minutes prior to this). She then said, ""Okay, so you are just here to play basketball?"" and I replied ""ummm, yes?"" hoping it would get me away from this awkward sales pitch where she was just staring at me when I said I wasn't currently interested. Instead, she then said ""Okay, well since you are here just to play basketball you will have to pay our $10.00 one day pass"" our associate at the front desk will help you. Then she walked me to the front and said he needs to pay the $10 and walked away. I was very confused as I had just signed up to receive emails/mail/marketing phone calls from you and in turn a free 3-day pass. The associate at the front desk said that there was a clause saying they could nullify the 3-day pass at their discretion which they do if you are just there to play basketball. I was confused to I went back to my car to get my wallet to pay 10$ to use my free 3day pass and proceeded to play basketball for a few hours.

I am new to Arizona (just got my new Arizona Drivers License today actually) and this is the closest gym to where I live. I'm probably going to go out of my way to ""Just play basketball"" somewhere else where they aren't time-share salesman. Honestly, I would have gladly just paid the $10 day pass but when you are presented the free 3-Day pass why not right? Here is the exact text from their email/website

Upon entering, I must say the place was extremely CLEAN. Might be one of the cleanest bars in town. 

The menu was nothing special. No steaks or chicken. Just burgers, appetizers & salads. 

Had the Chef Salad. The salad was fresh. had tons of tomatoes (which I was very happy about), but did not have any personality to it. Was just an average plate. 

Prices slightly higher than what I would like. $16 for a sampler platter for them seems a bit high. This isn't Claim Jumper. 

Service was decent. Not under-attentive or overly friendly. But it was not a weak point. 

Maybe if you want a place that is clean, well lit, & knock down some suds, this could be your spot. If you are seeking dinner, this is not the place.",0,0,-1

The moving crew showed up late the day of our move short staffed (including one who wore flip flops the entire day and talked on his Bluetooth complaining about having to work while just standing in the truck). They did not bring the proper moving equipment and were incredibly unprofessional. They were completely careless throughout the move, did not wrap any furniture nor secure it in the truck. To the surprise of absolutely no one, their recklessness led to thousands of dollars of damage to multiple pieces of our furniture and to our home. They also attempted to hide broken pieces of furniture before I could uncover the damage. 

After over a month of not returning any of my messages, All My Sons responded only to refuse to offer any reimbursement for services charged or even repair certain items they clearly damaged.

0,"My computer glasses broke in half. Since I work downtown in Pittsburgh, I figured I would go to 3 Guys Optical across the street from where I work rather than my usual eye glass place. I showed them the glasses and asked if they could put the lenses which were not damaged into new frames. They said no problem its Friday so you can pick them up Monday. Now realize I cannot do any reading or computer work without glasses. I am taking on line courses at night and I work in front of a computer all day. My old glass place takes about 2 weeks to get glasses and I have to drive to it so I figured I could save some time since I was downtown next to 3 guys.
Well its Tuesday now and they have not started on the glasses. In fact when I called they said they were afraid to fit the lenses into new frames since if they cut them there may be a gap between the frame and the lenses so the lenses would not fit properly, may crack or fall out or my eyes would be drawn to the place. As of now I will pick up the lenses and have to take them to my old glass place anyway. They also complained about how hard it was to refund my insurance allotment for frames for $135 which they already billed my insurance company for. I also paid $30 cash for the lens cutting. When I asked about that refund they said they have no cash on the premises. However on Friday I paid with 2 twenties and they gave me ten dollars change. So I have to wait for a check from the company.

If they would have told me upfront that they would need to keep my vehicle. I would have NEVER gone to them! Another Case of Bad Business practices. No wonder this company has so many complaints!

Sweet hostess greeted and seated us. Ordered off the$8.99 lunch menu which includes an eggroll and soup. I had the Pad Thai with the lemongrass (Tom Yum) soup. The Pad Thai was too sweet and the soup was way too strong (overkill in the flavor department), the eggroll was tasty and crispy. Hubby had the Pad See Ew and added beef, he chose the coconut soup as the accompaniment; the beef was over tenderized but I liked the flavor of the noodles. The coconut soup was too heavy on the coconut flavor. 

Thai food is really tricky to cook, there are many different ingredients that go into a dish that can't be substituted.

We got there early and ordered the appetizer sampler platter (onion rings, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and jalapeño poppers). I ended up bringing the platter back up to the bartender after trying a bit of each thing because it was that unappetizing. It was clear the oil used to fry the stuff was not fresh. The bartender took it back like this sort of thing happens all the time and said she'd take it off the tab without me even having to ask. For that, I add one star. The other star is for $5 Jack Daniels drinks all the time. That's not a bad deal at all for a location on the strip. I didn't partake in the beer pong tournament, just observed. It's a $20 per person entry fee. There ends up being a winners bracket and a losers bracket. And in the final game, the winner of the winners bracket ends up playing against the winners of the losers bracket... The losers have to win two games in a row to get first place, but the winners only have to win one game. Not sure how I feel about that... One thing that seemed dumb was that whoever ends up in 2nd place wins $50. Considering it's $40 for a team to enter, I think that's a lame prize to just basically win back your entry fee plus $5 each for you and your partner.

7,"Today my wife and I spent the day with my mother in law. We decided to go out to eat before we started our day. 
Let me start off by saying how pack it was. We still got seated fairly quickly which made me super happy. I was kinda hungry , once we were seated we got to talking and enjoying each other company when I realized we were seated for a while and no one came to take our drink order. 
I begin to look around and I notice the staff. The people busing the tables were fast and had great communication the servers on the other hand didn't have it together at all . They were all over the place. 

It took close to 10 minutes to place a drink order. Afterward a different server try's to take our drink order again we tell him we already did but instantly regretted it  because it took longer to receive our drinks. Seriously I'm surprised they remembered to take our food order down, which by the way we were  ready to order for a while by then. After everyone orders I ask if they have seasoned fries our server tells me yes. So I order the seasoned fries instead of regular fries to go with my order .  

It took so long to get our food  by this time I was getting annoyed because I came in hungry sitting for 40 some odd minutes in a restaurant was making it worse, and after everything Tell me why I receive plain French Fries? I tell the lady who is serving us I should have seasoned fries and she looked like I spoke a different language... saying, "" we don't have seasoned fries""  I tell her your other server who took the order said you did. At least she offered to get me something else which I tell her no but at least she asked I just didn't want to wait longer to eat whatever I decide to replace it with. 

Our meal took forever to arrive and when it did half of it was stone cold my mother in law had to request fresh pancakes. And I repeatedly had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. I would not recommend coming here to this location.  

And the funniest part was after we were already almost done the lady who took my order brought me season for my fries ...",2,1,-1

0,"This was my second time coming to this restaurant. It's close enough to my work so I hoping it would be my go to spot for Mexican food. But I will continue looking since it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The first time I went I ordered the Burrotote (Big Burrito) it's a joke. its more of a large taco.  Besides the false advertisement its flavor was bland especially since it has iceberg lettuce. 

I gave them another chance since it's supposed to be known for their Tortas anyway. I ordered the cochinita pibil Torta. I ordered it but the problem was that I was left waiting for my food for 25 minutes and when I went and asked the cook for my sandwich he said someone else had taken it. I went up to the counter where I ordered and the lady at the front ignored me. So I walk back to the cook and asked him to make it to go.

I was hoping to see sugar and calorie counts.  a large smoothie seems half the size of jambas and cost a lot more.  there is a window where you can see the workers in back all having a good time and barely working on your order and I was told the owner was there!  the tropical smoothie I got was so so.  wont be back.,0,0,-1

4,"Hello all you foodies out there :)

Today I will give you our opinion of JOES BBQ.

And I do realize food is a preference and I am a very picky person.

I realize Joes has its local following, however from a girl who has tried many of the BBQ joynts here in the greater Phoenix area I have to say.... I DONT GET IT?

I was being fair in trying Joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.

We first went to Joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slab of ribs and a combo plate with chicken, ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.

I enjoy some good ""fall off the bone"" ribs but what I got was a slab of ""pry off the bone"" ribs.

I must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was tough and chewy and I was extremely dissapointed.

On the combo place the chicken was dry as were the meats.

I would like to compliment the MAC and CHEESE which is better than most and the BBQ BEANS were also tasty.

I called  Joes to ask if I could bring back the ribs, of which I ate 2 bones, and get our money back and I was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.

She insisted their ribs are normally ""fall off the bone"".

I told her I would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on, but she talked me into trying again.

Ok, so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on Gilbert Rd and decided to  try again.

We got a 1/4 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 1/3 pd bbq pork sandwich.

The order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which I prefer chopped.

When we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what I am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.

NO bbq sauce on the side!

The bbq pork was plain, dry,  big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce, not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.

Both sandwiches were thrown away... 

For dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.

So now I have to ask again.....PEOPLE..... PLEASE get in your car and drive into Phoenix to BOBBY Q's BBQ and give their food a try.

I realize we all want a good place close to home but Joe's simply doesn't do it for us.

Luckily the gift card we received is also good at JOES farmhouse grill...which is a fun place to visit, otherwise we would have sent the card back with a ""thanks...but no thanks.... even free it's not worth it!

We would rather drive 1/2 hour to BOBBY Q's and enjoy some real good BBQ.

You can look back at my review of BOBBY Q's.  

We went there many times and have NEVER been dissapointed and I am a TOUGH critic!

I would suggest if you decide to eat at Joe's, try the root beer...it is quite good!

If you enjoy corn bread..... dont eat it here...it is $2.29 for a small square of thin corn bread.  The taste is ok, but not at all worth the price.

And so I repeat.... I DONT GET IT!  nor do I like it! Nor will be back or recommend  Joe's to anyone.

This is just 2 peoples opinion, but as I always suggest.... give it a try and see what you think, and before you make a decision...try BOBBY Q's and compare.

And until you do......

2,"Ok, I wasn't expecting a lot when my husband and I wanted something quick to eat and a little different and our usual Rubios, but I should have trekked a little further to Pei Wei. 

I was craving pad thai and I knew this place had it, so I order that with no meat. I then asked if I could have tofu instead. The guy at the counter asked if I wanted the tofu deep fried. I said no and my husband ordered two egg rolls. The total was $19! I knew that was off, so when I mentioned it, he said that the tofu was a brick of tofu. I told him I didn't need a whole block of tofu, just some to put in my pad thai. He then said he couldn't do that? What?? You can sell whole blocks of it, but you can't put it in my food? I said no to the tofu and waited for our food.

After we got home, I opened my food to find big chuncks of beef, chicken, and shrimp in my pad thai. I'm a vegetarian, so that's not good. My wonderful husband took it back for me and when he returned, I only ate about 5 bites. Wasn't good at all. Next time, I'll stick with Pei Wei. Maybe I'll have that for lunch!",0,2,-1
2,"Like other reviewers, I don't mind the Keg despite it being a chain. They normally offer good food and you get what you expect. Because it is higher end, the service is usually a little better than most other chains. Except at this location.

From the moment you walk in, the serving staff are running around in chaotic mode (this has happened on more than one occasion!). Trading tables, trying to figure out who has been seated where. It is stressful to watch while you wait. Our most recent visit was no exception.

Once we were seated, our server arrived and was clearly overwhlemed before she even filled out water. It was just starting to get busy but it was by no means packed. While throughout our meal she was friendly when she could get to our table, she was hardly able to keep up and was slow in coming by. She also was very soft spoken and had an accent, making it hard for most of ehr tables to understand her. I felt bad for her.

Our food was ok. Mine was really good (steak with a special limited time lobster medallion). My boyfriends however was less than great, with his steak having an odd mushy texture. He ate it anyway as we had waited a long time for our food (as had several complaining tables around us). He also had ordered a specialty coffee which while tasty, was ice cold.

Pizza did not look freshly made.  They had little soba bowls that were already half dipped in sauce so it was half dry and half soggy.  Disappointed they didn't have any oysters.

The last few visits have left me really disappointed and I may or may not go back, but I certainly will never go for their early bird dinner again.  The restaurant was so full we stood around waiting for a table (of course you don't know this when you pay the bill and they are herding you through the line like cattle).  It took almost 20 minutes to get a plate of food because the line was moving at a snails pace and you had to reach through and grab things within your reach rather than fight the herd to get to the food you want.  Finally got back to my table and they were so close and cramped in, I had to sit all hunched up.  Between the pain of standing in line for so long, the claustrophobic atmosphere, and the fact that I was not able to get to the decent items in the buffet, I left my full plate and walked out.  Wasted over $30 for the three of us to have dinner.  The worst part is that this was a better visit than my previous one.  But that is another story.

I was told that I had to talk to Steven (I think that was his name), and that he was the ONE person in the store who could help me.

I may not be the most tech-savvy person in the world, but I'm not a Luddite.  I know about the phones, the software, the updates and new features.  I can read a tech blog as well as the next guy.  All I needed to know was some information on the finer points of Apple's new upgrade program and whether or not they had the phone I wanted in stock.  First, it took forever because there were a lot of people and they had more questions about the phones themselves (which is totally fine!) and there wasn't anyone else who could answer my questions, apparently.  Then, when we finally got to talk to him, Steven (or whatever his name was) talked to my mother and I like we were tiny children, ignored me when I told him what my questions were, questioned my choices about what phone I was interested in, and generally sucked.  It was the MOST condescending, patronizing lecture I have ever heard in my life.  Like a caricature of the snotty tech guy, but a real person.  We watched him talk this way to every person he encountered, giving condescending advice that got in the way of any actually helpful answers.

In April 2007 however I was having problems with it (during the nba playoffs too, awful timing). I arranged for a service call for a very wide window of 3-7 and specifically told them to call my landline# when they got here because I have no doorbell. Well they dont call when they get here (assuming they came), didnt leave a voicemail saying ""hey I was there but nobody answered, call me and maybe I can swing by tonite), no notes left on the door, no emails. No nothing. I was irate. I called them up and cancelled their service. They tried blaming it on the old neighborhood I live in. Whatever. I switched to DirecTV and it was way better.

I also have been a cox high speed internet customer since about 2002 or 2003. Unfortunately, there has been a trend the last 5-6 years where my internet service is constantly going out. Most recently, I am taliking like on for 2 hours, off for 2 hours, and this went on since memorial day weekend 2013. I finally called Cox up to have it fixed and the guy came out and blamed it on my computer. Well yes my computer is old. But it never had any problem getting internet before. I even tried a new modem and still nothing. Well that was it. I switched over to Dish internet (who I also now have my tv with). It is a little bit cheaper than COX even with me renting the dish modem (which I do not like). When I called COX to cancel my internet, they were very pleasant and tried offering me a special one year price of like $30 less per month than what I am currently being charged and would have been about $12 less per month than with Dish. However I already had dish come over and no matter what COX internet charges me, I still have to have that cloud of unreliability hanging over my head. And I have had to call them to come over to my house literally dozens of times to fix my interrupted service. My Dish is DSL so its maybe a bit slower but hardly noticeable and it is a dedicated service line so I am cautiously optimistic I wont get the same interruption of service issues I have seen with COX far too many times. Funny thing is, if you added up all the hours my internet service with COX was out the last 6 years, it literally would add up to at least a month or 2 of service. Yet I never got any credits from them for that, they always say it has to be out at least 1 day before you get any credit. To say nothing of all the aggravation I have to go thru making sure I am home to satisfy their outrageous 4 hour window to show up at my house. 

So when the COX rep said it would be about 4 days before the COX folks could come out here and cut my wires, even though I said I am ready to end the service right now on this call, I asked her would I be billed for those 4 days I wouldnt be using their service. She said yes. Oh well, as I said, I basically paid them 1-2 months worth of downtime, so whats paying them 4 more days of not getting service going to be.

I am willing to pay a decent price for my internet but I absolutely have to have reliable and continuous service with very very minimal interuptions. I bid on ebay auctions. I pay bills the day they are due with my internet. I do school assignments with my internet. I simply cannot trust Cox internet to give me a reliable connection and so I had to cancel with them. Quite frankly most others would have dropped them a long long time ago. I only dropped them as of today.",0,0,-1

They over load you with paperwork and crap and you do not get to process everything, especially with an adorable puppy in your arms. Not only that, but our dog was REALLY sick in the afternoon the next day. Why would they sell me a sick dog for 3000?

Overall a terrible experience, I would not recommend anyone going there. Purchase straight from a breeder for the rarer breeds to avoid the third party costs.

And not just that, everything is expensive including the ""free"" starter kit they used.

5,"Wow.  I have NEVER not left a tip but my service was so horrible I put a big fat zero on the tip line.  What astonished me was when I went to give my paid check to the manager to make sure he knew how dissatisfied I was, I was told my horrible server was the manager!

That being said, the food is great and in the past I enjoyed eating at the sushi bar.  But I will NEVER eat at a table again and I will not take my family (meaning visits will be far and few between).  

In family centric Anthem, this place will not survive with the current manager at the helm.  With the good food, I hope the problem is remedied soon.

Some specifics on the service:
- It took forever to get our order taken so I took my boys on a walk while my husband ordered (plus, they failed to give us a pencil for our sushi order sheet).
- When our first order of sushi came out, we didn't have any sushi sets.  When I asked our waiter/the manager for some, he looked at me like I was crazy and said, you mean the little bowls?  When I tried to also add we needed ginger and wasabi he seemed very confused and finally said, oh ginger.
- It wasn't until after the tempura, then cucumber salad, then sushi order, and finally the next sushi order that he brought the kids meals out (by then, my kids were fit to be tied!).  He failed to bring a fork and knife.  I waited a bit, and finally ran around the restaurant to find him.  When I did, he said it would take a minute because he was entering in an order (mind you, I had a boy desperately waiting to eat his chicken fingers but the were huge and hot so they needed to be cut, he's 2, and chopsticks were useless to cut the chicken with).  I don't know why he couldn't just ask someone else to get them for me, it isn't often a customer comes and hunts you down, it usually means they are desperate for service!
- He brought the silverware, and ran off, while our drinks were completely empty.  Had to wave him down again to get water refills.
- The final straw was at then end.  He asked if we wanted anything else, and three times, I said the check please (anyone could tell at that point I was frustrated and ready to just leave).  He brought the check over (by then, my dad and son had left the restaurant, my husband was packing up my other son).  He then left for a LONG time.  I saw him on the other side of the restaurant just hanging out talking casually with a waitress.  I waited, and waited.  My husband left and I am now all alone at the table.  I get up and try to pay the hostess - can't.  She finally gets the waiter/manager.  But seriously - your a waiter/manager., your customer tells you three times to just bring the check, the table clears out with just one person left who is staring at you WAITING for to pay the bill --- Did I really have to go ask the hostess, and why couldn't the hostess cash me out?!?

There were 1000 other little things the whole evening that had me tearing my hair out.  In all, I will NEVER return with my family.  That being said, unless I find another sushi place in Anthem, the food is good enough to return to the sushi bar when my husband and I want a quiet night out and Grandpa can babysit the boys.",1,1,-1
1,"Felt like it's a three star place, but downgrade because everyone else is overrating it.

Came here for lunch on Friday, pithiest way I can describe the place: ""run-of-the-mill""  The food was terribly bland and service was average.  Prices were okay.  

Special of the Day: Penne Pasta with Salmon - it was lukewarm by the time they brought it out.  Panini - tasted fine but not enough flavor.  Salad - I don't need a lot of dressing for my salad, but this definitely needed more.  Lunch takes a long time to serve too.

I recall there is another korean restaurant in Etobicoke (near Islington station?) and I remember liking the food more there.

0,"When I came in for an oil change and tire rotation the service representative tried upselling me ""scheduled maintenance"" when my 2014 impala had 31k miles.  After reviewing all of the ""scheduled maintenance"" that was hand written (which should have gave me my first clue that I was being ripped off), I decided that all that I could possibly need from the list was a transmission flush.  The scheduled maintenance cost went from about $500 to $200 which I agreed with at the time.  After getting home I looked at my owners manual and in the service schedule part of my manual I saw that I was not to have my transmission oil changed until it reaches 45k miles.  So I felt a bit swindled into paying for maintenance that was not due for another 14k miles.  So there is a possibility that when I go to Henderson Chevrolet service department I have to make sure that the technicians are bing honest with me before I purchase anymore ""scheduled maintenance"".",0,0,-1

1,"The first time I came here was for my boyfriend's birthday
I was super excited, because the name of it is pretty unique and the outdoor sign seemed like it would be pretty cool and upscale! 
The bouncers outsider were super disorganized, putting us in another line (people with booths) and then separating our group by accident. They even put a few random dudes in our line and they ended up getting free cover because the bouncers thought they were part of us..

The inside of the club was not that bad, it had nice lighting and it was pretty spacious with two big random pillar things in the middle. The booths were pretty dungy though.. I wouldn't be too sure on sitting on them, even though I did because I got hella tired. 
The music was top 40, but if I could describe it, I would say 'ratchet top 40'... the remixes did not sound good at all and when the beat dropped, it just made me go ""...oh"" and that's NOT a good reaction to have while listening to music. 
The washrooms are so sketchy, it's barely lit and the stalls don't lock properly- it was disgusting and gave off the image of 'hey, come in here and do some coke!' 

The crowd is pretty creepy in my opinion, and there are many freshly legal kids that are way too eager. No means no. I was dancing with my boyfriend and the same kid kept coming up to me and asking ""are you with anyone?"" WHILE I was dancing with my bf..... are you a joke?

That must have been a ""gotcha"" moment for her as she really started pulling on my heartstrings, telling me it would be the last time I would see him, etc and I did get quite emotional.

Service was mediocre, only due to the fact that they brushed it off with a 'I don't care' attitude when I brought that up to the server. Only reason I give two stars was that the supervisor at least gave me some sort of answer and allowed me to swap it out.

Their desert looks so good on the menu but when we ordered it, you can tell it's low quality with ingredients you can buy in the grocery and make yourself at home.

5,"My 2014 tax return had been hacked and the IRS was holding my refund for my 2015 return (I owed the IRS money in 2014 so there was no refund due for that year). They had given me PIN numbers for my 2015 return but I still had to appear in person at the IRS office to prove that I was who I claimed to be. Their office is now by appointment only so there were no lines at the door or thru their security. There were maybe only about ten people in the waiting room. I arrived early because I did not know if there would be lines or not and did not want to miss my appointment and have to come back another day. The regular lady receptionist was very friendly, took my name and told me to have a seat. She was not giving out numbers. When it was your turn she just called out your name. After a while she went to lunch and a middle aged grumpy man took over at the check in desk. When the next persons turn came up he called out a number. We all looked at each other as he called out the number again. Someone told him no one has numbers. So then he looked on his computer screen and called out a name. He seemed irritated that none of us had numbers but it was not our fault. A couple more times he called out numbers and having no responses then called out names. When my name was called he handed me a small number ticket. I asked him which cubicle was I supposed to go to. He told me to look at my ticket. There was a small scribble that he had marked on my ticket that looked like the letter B. I asked him where B was located. He said rudely that is was 13, not a B. I hold two engineering degrees and a MBA and know the difference between the letter B and the number 13 had he written it clearly and not run it all together. He could have just told me rather than trying to write it on the little ticket in half inch tall numbers. He was also rude to people standing in line waiting to check in. Complete opposite from the regular lady receptionist who had checked me in. This guy needs some customer service training. I am lucky he was not the person who would be reviewing my return. When I got to desk 13 there was a not too friendly but very professional lady who took my 2015 tax return, mine and my wife's drivers licenses, SS cards, military ID's, and passports. She did a lot of typing into the computer and at first could not find my return. When I told her that during my last phone call (over the past year I had made over twenty phone calls to various IRS departments at different phone numbers) I was told by the TPP Division (whatever that is) that I needed to appear in person and they had made the appointment for me that she found my return. She again went to her computer and I am guessing verified what I had given her on my paper copy against what she was seeing on the computer. She asked me a few questions about how much income was shown on W-2 forms vs. 1099-R forms, did some more typing and told me it would be nine weeks before I would either get a follow up letter or my refund. I didn't say anything but was thinking why another nine weeks? If they had to verify I was really who I claimed to be in person why could my refund not be processed right away? And what kind of follow up might be needed? But at least what ever information they needed from me they now had and they could complete my 2015 return.

After the men had completed the job (even adding an extra stop to our storage unit at no charge), we had to wait around in the parking lot for an hour trying to pay Michael. The movers, as well as my fiance and I, called multiple times telling him we were ready to process our credit card. After many excuses, no apology, and an hour later, it was finally processed. I have never had to work so hard to GIVE my money to somebody.

2,"I have been to the Waterworks Burgatory as well as the spot at Consol Arena and the food truck at Mario's Livingroom. I have enjoyed their burgers and shakes many times. So, when they opened in the Waterfront, I was very excited. As a Waterfront ""local"", I waited for a while before venturing over there. New restaurant openings there always attract a huge crowd. Today, my husband and I went there for lunch at noon. It was busy but the wait was only 10 minutes. I gave my cell number to the hostess and even though I got a text to see the hostess because my table was ready, it wasn't ready when I went inside. We had to wait for them to clear and wipe the table before being seated. My brother had recommended the Espresso Love shake. I've had their hard shakes before, so I ordered that shake and so did my husband. The tequila in the shakes were overpowering. Never before have I had a Burgatory hard shake where the alcohol was so overwhelming. Even the man at the table next to us made mention of the same thing. The waitress who took our order was very nice, but one guy brought us our shakes and a completely different guy brought us our meals. I hope they tip share because other than taking our order and taking away our empty plates and things, she did little else. The special burger of today was a chorizo burger with pulled pork on top. My husband ordered that and said it was the dryest thing he had ever tasted. He made comparisons to the Sahara and the Gobi when describing this  burger. I did a Create your Own burger. I ordered a beef  burger with provolone, mushrooms, pickles and a sweet onion rub on the beef. I have to cut most all sandwiches in half and when I cut this in half, it just oozed greasy. The bottom of the wheat bun was saturated with greasy juices. Also, their assembly of the burger goes against all conventional thinking which, in this case, was NOT a good thing. They put the cold pickles against the hot provolone cheese, then the lettuce and then put the sauteed mushrooms on top of the lettuce so they fell out all over the place. Whoever cleared this burger to be served was NOT paying attention or doesn't know what they are looking at as my mushrooms were all over the basket before I even laid eyes on my burger. The sea salt and herb fries needs to drop the herbs. They don't suit the fries and they don't suit beef. The flavors clash. I had to use a lot of ketchup to cover the herb flavor. I might come back here if i'm just going to have a short bite, but not for a full meal. I was sadly disappointed with Burgatory after all my great previous experiences with them.

Are you serious? I wouldn't go back here even if I was desperate for food after a night out of drinking and dancing. This place was disgusting. I wish I can give this place several negative stars. I bet prison food probably tastes better than what these people are trying to conjure up. 

The service sucked, the sprite or 7up was watered down, food was gross and it was expensive. The service was slow, drinks weren't refilled, they didn't check on you once to ask you how everything was, you have to wave many times to get someone's attention for the check (get me the hell outta there ASAP!), even though I said that the soda tastes weird (I had a cold mind you but I could still taste how there wasn't enough syrup) and that the syrup was probably low, it didn't matter because the drink lady sure didn't change it or care and I couldn't understand what the hell words was coming out of her mouth. Maybe I should have tried to speak in her native tongue and we could have gotten somewhere. 

The food was so bland and oily. I've made better soup the first time I attempted to make it and I'm no cook either! The chicken soup with veggies (forgot what it was called but it was one of the more expensive ones per the server's suggestion) was mainly water broth, noodles, and veggies all thrown into a bowl. I should have known something was up when the only things on the table spruce up the food was soy sauce and chili paste. Seriously? We also ordered the beef stir-fry noodle which was also tasteless. The beef, however was tender and good. Why does it have to be so OILY though? To try and mask their terrible attempt at Asian cuisine? 

Don't be duped into going here just because the people that work there (yes, including the cooks) were Asian like we were! Seriously, $40 for bland soup and chowfun? I was starving and I still couldn't force myself to finish 3 bites of the soup. I seriously contemplated on sticking a note on their menu that's outside their restaurant to warn potential customers of their business.

4,"So I'll start off with saying I've been a loyal customer and referred many friends and people to Cookie Cutters since it's opening. They do have some amazing stylist's there and it's a shame that they will now be losing my business as well as many others after the horrible interaction I had today with the owner, Leasa. I went in thinking I had an appointment today that I booked through the app. It turned out it was for Tuesday of next week. That's obviously on me and while I was in there I was offered a time to re-schedule while keeping the appointment with Lauren, my son's favorite stylist. She's amazing and has a lot of patience with my son who has sensory processing disorder. We settled on the following day which worked out great seeing as how a flash email coupon I had received would have been redeemable then. While I was in there, another mom had inquired about the emailed coupon and wanted to know if they would honor it a day early for her. We were making small talk amongst ourselves (or so I thought) and I had mentioned how prices had recently increased and how expensive it is for children's hair cuts considering how often they need them. I rebooked  and was on my way, looking forward to seeing Lauren the next day. A couple hours later I get a very unprofessional and angry phone call from Leasa saying that she was told I was complaining about the prices. It was nothing more than a (private) conversation between two mothers about the cost and frequency of children's haircuts which an employee apparently eavesdropped on and then reported the owner. Leasa's tone was very condescending and I really couldn't believe that she thought it was appropriate to call to begin with. She asked if I still wanted my appointment for tomorrow to which I said yes. She then snidely asked if I was sure and then suggested that I'd be happier taking my business elsewhere. If I was so unhappy (not the case) I wouldn't have booked and kept coming back. She had mentioned I have complained before and seem hard to please and that if I have any issues I need to contact her directly. I have had one previous issue where my daughter's hair was cut much shorter than I requested and was simply told that I wouldn't get that stylist again. No apology or anything and even then I was still willing to give Cookie Cutters my business. This afternoon's phone call completely crossed the line and to be honest I still can't get over the fact that Leasa thought it was appropriate to do in the first place.

6,"I got a nasty comment and just got harassed on Yelp from someone for this review, who OBVIOUSLY didn't read my other 5 star review. This is NOT the first problem I had at Teppan Bento. They repeated the same mistake two times. And this time handled it very very wrong. So I changed my review. If they have financial repercussions because of this one review then I'm obviously not the only reason why.
So I just ordered grub hub for Teppan Bento. I attached what I requested in my order and what I received. I ordered rare steaks, spicy mayo, regular rice. On both my boxes I got well done steak, no sauces I ordered, and wrong rice on one of the boxes. When grub hub requested they fix it, they refused saying they did nothing wrong. 
I've been to Teppan Bento around five times but I will never come back. They disappointed me, and the woman who is the elderly manager said I was lying. Well here are your pictures, and I'm removing my 5 star review. 
Very rude to serve me wrong food and lie about it. 
I won't even be asking for a refund, I will simply not come back and tell everyone I know not to come here. It's a shame because I loved the guy who worked here and he was so polite.

4,"This far this has been a two star experience; had to negotiate a time to do an estimate since it was made clear they won't come up outside of 8 am to 330 pm. 

I sent an inquiry online through yelp, and was called within a few hours. Upon getting on the phone I was informed that estimates were only given between 8 am and 430 pm, Monday they Friday. This made it quiet inconvenient for me to arrange a time during working hours when I have an hour commute. I got the guy on the phone to commit to having someone at my door at 8 am on Friday (I had arranged this on Tuesday). 

Friday comes around, 8 am. 8:05. 8:10. Get a call that says ""I will be there in 15 to 20""; now I am sure this company does good work based off reviews and pictures, but arranging to call 15 minutes after an agreed meeting time doesn't spell out customer service. Maybe the attitude changes after money has exchanged hands, but certainly puts a sour outlook on me picking an electrician in a multiple bid situation. 

Electro an shows up for the bid at 8:30 and is quite friendly. He comes in, I explain what I am looking for. He takes a few pictures of the area where the work will be done, then says we will get you an estimate ASAP. I am not sure why I couldn't take the very same pictures of my ceiling and send them in without arguing on the phone to arrange a time (that wasn't met), but I digress. 

Another frustrating factor was getting an email at 430 pm on Friday afternoon stating my estimate wouldn't be ready until Monday. For a minor situation, this seems like a ton of run around, disorganization, and disregard for time. Low and behold the estimate is over 600 dollars to just install lights while cutting into drywall and not repairing it. Why would I pay someone to tear into the roof and then not repair it? The entire point of having a professional do it is so they would be able to run the electrical lines through the structure.

It was 100 degrees and hot but more than that we had terrible service.  I don't understand the music being so loud that you can even speak to one another at your table?  We weren't the only table outside but it sure felt like it, as we were largely forgotten.

Our drinks were rarely refilled, we both ordered raspberry or strawberry lemonades and never received a refill!  Not one.  Our water was only filled twice.  We had to ask twice for silverware!  My husbands steak dish was over cooked and he wanted to order rice but the server never checked on us after that point, and we also ordered 3 sushi rolls but never received wasabi or soy sauce and the PONZU YELLOWTAIL ROLL was missing the chili sauce.  I asked for sauce and it never came.  Our server was defensive and dismissive.

A manager did come by to ask how our meal was and when we started to tell him he apologized and gave us a free appetizer for our next visit.  I honestly don't think a measly free appetizer will entice us to come back after we spent over $70.00 on a poorly prepared meal and had terrible service.",0,0,-1
1,"This hotel definitely feels like luxury when you walk into the lobby.  The downstairs restaurant and front desk look awesome.  Staff is very friendly and they try to take good care of you.

The rooms themselves are very designer centic...with some weird choicese for things like lights, wall paper, etc.  Unfortunately, once you get past the visual stimulation, you find that several other things are kind of impractical or not function forward.  The way the bird cage light turns off and on is both strange and a bit confusing.  The room is very ""open"" but also a bit small, which means it's kind of echoey.  While the door provides a visual barrier to the hallway, the sound barrier is nearly non-existent...mornings are filled with the sounds of guests talking, staff knocking on doors and talking, doors slamming, and the like...all of which sounds like it's *in* your room.  Additionally, it seems like the vents in the bathroom do a pretty good job of transmitting noise.  

The bathroom again, looks nice...but showers that don't have curtains or full doors means that water ends up all over the floor no matter what you do, so you get a wet bathmat and/or floor after every shower.  I slipped on the wet floor once...was not my favourite.  Note the bathroom is shower only (no tub), which didn't bother me but just FYI.

At first I was excited to stay on the 9th (top) floor.  The views from the room toward the US Steel Building were decent, including a pretty and colourful fountain.  However, the 9th floor has the biergarten (when it's open), which means noisy guests going to the bathrooms and elevators that serve it, plus pretty noisy staff in the room adjacent.  More noise to disturb your sleep.

The biergarten is a cool concept, but didn't look like much when I went to check it out.  It was also closed most of my stay, since it's closed on Monday and Tuesday anyway and on Thursday they closed it due to weather.

The gym was pretty nice.  Not huge, but a lot of good options and equipment.

The restaurant downstairs was nice and seemed to have good options and be popular.  The cocktails were very expensive, and honestly didn't sound very good...but everything else looked pretty solid.

The street the hotel is on is fine, but busy.  Hard for catching an Uber in the morning, or waiting for your car from valet.

If you forget something like toothpaste, shaving cream, etc, the hotel is happy to give you some for free--and it's all very nice, travel sized items.

Overall, the hotel was okay but not great.  If I had to stay here on my next trip I'd be okay with it, but I don't think I'll choose it--especially since it's more expensive than the other options.",0,0,-1

We visited on February 3rd with no reservation and treated like dirt to be honest. Told we could sit at the bar, which is great, that's actually what we prefer. We were celebrating a special occasion, had a Groupon for 2 tastings and an app. We both traded our tastings in for glasses.

But the worst was housekeeping service. The first day, the room was not made when we retured from the pool at 3 PM.  As soon as we lied down to get some rest, the maid knocked on the door to come in and we had to leave the room.  The next day she did not come at all.  We called Housekeeping at 4:00 and they sent someone at 4:30.  The third day no one came.  We had to call Housekeeping again at 4:30.  They promised to send someone ""rightaway "".  We left for dinner and the show.  When we returned at 9:30, guess what ? The room still had not made.  We called Housekeeping and was told that the day shift crew had left and the evening crew is at lunch break.  They promised to send someone in 15 minutes.  After almost 1 hour, we had to call again.

It was one of those days that I wanted a fat burrito. 
Cool thing is they can pan fry your burrito so that it gets crispy. However, the order was a bit more work for drive-through than expected. 

The standard carne asada burrito comes with beans, pico de gallo, and rice. I paid extra to add the triple mixing of sour cream, guacamole, and cheese. 

I'm not used to ordering a burrito that doesn't come with what I would think are the basics. 

Even with the additions, I'd give this burrito 2 stars. Decent, but far from good. 

I'll be back to give the tacos a shot in the future, but maybe not for a while with the choice of plenty other tacos available.

0,"Full disclosure: I understand the nature of Midas warranties and that they need to be honored only at Midas locations. My main point is the lack in basic customer service which I would say is not worth taking your car in. 

Recently at an oil change, Midas caught a leak significant to warrant dropping a lot of money into a repair. The service was fast, and the rep was helpful enough through it all. It was fine. The parts and labor came with a year warranty only at Midas locations. 

Less than three months later, one of the newly put in parts broke or became faulty with no outstanding circumstances to cause it, in turn causing me to need a long tow and more work done (circumstantially is was very stressful). Additionally the situation brought up another issue in my car that also needed to be fixed. I did not take it into Midas because the tow was closer, and because I trust my mechanic more. 

After the second repair, I wanted to let Midas know what happened, thinking they would care. Kind of wondering if they would offer something for the situation, but never really assuming they would honor the warranty given the circumstances. I explained what had happened and what my mechanic had claimed was likely a cheap part (not midas' fault per say, just that it's generally a cheaply made part, but in my mind, why would something 3 months old need repair without something major causing damage..) the rep on the phone, merely eking an apology, had little to say other than my warranty was not covered. No questions about my experience or what may have happened, no empathy or understanding, just mostly silence. Didn't even ask who I was or about the original repair. I was appalled that they had no care about the follow up to work they had done. I got the impression they didn't trust me enough to care if what I was saying was true or investigate at all into the issue, which I would assume would be basic customer service. If that is truly their perspective, bunched up into transactional warranties lacking genuine care for the work they do, I would not get any significant service done there. There are far better (and without a doubt cheaper) places out there who truly care about their work. Don't go to Midas.",0,0,-1

Security lines are incredibly long. I spent over 45 minutes at the main security line, so yesterday I decided to use the alternate line. Don't do it. There were only 10 or so people ahead of me and the line was still as slow as molasses. 

The bathrooms need serious updates, but the majority of the airport has gone a facelift in recent years. It's always pretty clean, and the staff is friendly. Even TSA is friendly. 

Three stars for the size and amount of people. Very busy.",0,0,0

1,"3.5 stars. Cheap and tasty. I've been here afew times, mainly for their desserts but I really like it here. I had the grass jelly bowl (hot) and taiwanese popcorn chicken. I was disappointed with the chicken since it was barely crunchy! It tasted good but I was looking forward to some crunchy, deep fried goodness. The grass jelly bowl was abit too sweet due to the red bean and taro paste, but it really soothed my throat. I loved the desert and I think it's perfect for the winter!

Even though I ordered the Rocker warm it came out luke warm - I expected hotter - a little too much sauce but the right amount of meat and cheese - overall the #13 was nothing special, but tasty. The garlic knots I could have done without - not what I expected - they were a little raw/doughy. The french onion soup was really good. The inside was very small and the line was very slow compared to the amount of people working at the time - I counted at least 5 people working, but only one taking orders. Because the place is so small, your clothes will smell like the place when you leave - I would like to see better ventilation.

I had to ask 3 times and I was asking extra nice just so she would finish making it nicely.

I ordered the eggs Benedict special, it was beautifully presented. (See attached picture) Overall the meal was good, however the eggs were overcooked. They should ask how we want the eggs done. 

Interestingly, they could not prepare an iced coffee. Perhaps they are not aware of the logistics of preparing coffee and pouring it over ice?

Welp, my steak arrived over cooked, almost to well done and my salad wasn't tossed and needed a touch more dressing.

Something about all eating together or none at all, I dunno. ‍ fries were good though, and my kilt lifter was cold.

0,"Judge a book by its cover, and disappointment will hover.  Or something like that.

I stay at Marriott more than any other hotel mostly because anytime I travel on business, I know they've got most of the stuff I care about.  Normally when I go to Westlake I stay at Townplace Suites (I would stay at Residence, except for when they have tons of sick children sneezing all over the breakfast, and that intersection revision right at the BP makes staying at Residence not as nice as it used to be for getting to my destination right down the road).  This latest time I decided to give Courtyard a try, since it already had the Bistro, free breakfast courtesy of my event.

That was a mistake that I won't repeat.

First let me be clear.  The hotel is ""OK"", as my rating says.  Problem is, both Townplace and Residence are significantly better in almost every way.  Courtyard looks nice, they've gone to great lengths to revitalize the look of the rooms, but they did way too much cost cutting under the hood, some of which are showstoppers.

- THE SHOWER.  OMG, the shower is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.  There's no steam vent at all, so you're getting fogged up windows and difficulty breathing, but more importantly, it's got that stupid ""save water!!!!"" type of spray nozzle where it's just weakly hitting you and there's no way to control the force.  Means it will take you twice as long to get clean than it should especially if you have a lot of hair.  What's more it was loose and didn't have the gasket tape on it, so it leaked while running.  

- The keycard didn't work half the time.  I had to swipe it like two or three times to get it to register both at the side entrance and to my room.

- The maid that cleaned my room didn't bother taking the previous guest's feedback card.  When I took it down to the front desk there was nobody there (seems a rather large security issue, IMO) for at least 10 minutes.  A guy in plain clothes walked from the gym, past me and back into the back room and yelled at somebody back there: ""Why aren't you in front?  There's somebody out there!!""  First thought is why he didn't just take care of my inquiry since he had to walk right past the desk to get to the back, but whatever.

- At the Bistro, everyone except ""Dan"" was botching orders left and right.  On one occasion a gal ordered a menu item that clearly indicated that orange juice was included, but the chick taking the order kept telling her it was an extra fee, until Dan walked by and hastily corrected her.

- At the Bistro, I ordered something and had to wait for a rather unreasonable amount of time to place my order.  The chick (a different one than the one above) tried to make amends by giving me what she referred to as a free coffee.  In truth, it was some sort of latte that some other customer had ordered that was sitting on the counter.  When I called this out (Dan happened to be there), she claimed it was coffee, but Dan looked and confirmed it wasn't coffee.  He got me the coffee I should have gotten initially.

- The Bistro does not butter toast.  They give you pats of butter if you want to use them.  Problem is that by the time you get your plate, the toast is already cold and the butter doesn't spread; I much prefer my toast to be buttered either during toasting or just after so that it's melted nicely (as Denny's and IHOP do it).  I made this as a suggested choice; Dan (surprisingly) argued with me : ""we give you butter!"" That's not the point.  Just ask the customer: ""would you like buttered or unbuttered toast"" when they order!

- The cleaning crew does not work around the clock on weekends, so when Saturday came around, there was all sorts of garbage and what smelled like urine in the elevator that remained there for an extended period.

- The business center doesn't allow you to just browse the Web, so if you use DropBox or Google Drive or some other sort of cloud product and your tickets/itineraries/work papers/etc are there, you'll not be able to use them to print anything.  You'll have to bring a USB stick (which is so 1990's).  You also won't be checking your company email either, so don't waste your time.

- Could have sworn I booked a King, but I ended up with two beds.  Not sure how that happened, but that's a small thing.

Anyway, the beauty is only skin deep on Courtyard.  There are tons of issues under the hood that made it NOT feel like a Marriott.  I felt welcomed when I first arrived - the guy was expecting me and knew me by name and got me checked in fast even though it was like 4AM - and the room looked nice on the surface...USB charging ports, etc.  But everything else was just not up to par.",0,0,0
0,This place is kinda hidden away from the rest of the food court food options but in a good way. There's plenty of space to sit and it's away from the hustle and bustle of the mall and food court. Sushi burritos and poke bowls are the average price but the ingredients are so fresh! I usually get the skinny/smaller size burrito and its honestly quite filling. It looks small but it packs a lot more than you'd think. I'm not sure how the drinks are but I know they offer bubble teas and smoothies now as well. One of the major things I love about this location is how you're able to get some work or hang out with friends for a bit longer. They have plugs by the seats too which is great to get some studying done and still be fed properly and adequately hydrated (they offer lemon water too!). I honestly thought i'd be just another average sushi place since the name was so similar to Su & Shi in the foodcourt (which im not too big of a fan for) but this surprised me!,0,0,0

Additionally, they are great at getting a child in for an appointment same day when sick or injured

I came in and ask the woman at the desk if she would please check to verify if I owed North Scottsdale Peds money as I felt I had received a bill in the mail, but I could not find it. 

I wasn't sure which child it was for so I started with my first born giving his name and birth date. I explained that since he has autism and is on DDD and AZ Longterm care, most of the time the state covers what Blue Cross does not in his case. I had barely finished my sentence when she snapped at me, ""Why don't you give me the information for a child you might have to pay for?!?!?"" 

I thought to myself, ""What the Hell?!?! How insensitive and unkind!!!"" 

I had also mentioned I would be needing a copy of my children's immunization records as they would be switching schools so when she told me I owed $17 for the bill, I attempted to hand the angry woman my AZ driver's license and credit card. 

""I only need a credit card,"" she stated like I was some kind of moron. 

I put my driver's license back in my wallet concerned that she was just going to give me my kids' immunization records after having me fill out a release of information form without even checking my identification to be sure I was really the mother of these children. What a terrible mistake.

Luckily for her, she realized her error, and asked for my driver's license after all. I sighed as I removed it from my wallet once more.

She gave me the immunization records with no signature or stamp from the office so I explained that I was a career federal employee and that Social Security would not accept the documents without a stamp or seal (otherwise there is no way for them to determine whether this was printed up at the pediatrician's office or if it was something I produced fraudulently on a home desktop computer.

Boy was that tiny request annoying to her. She snatched up the papers and without comment or acknowledgement, stamped them & returned them to me as though I had asked her to travel to Dubai or something.

This is ""customer no service.""

You can do better.
------------------
Not exaggerating when I tell you that I DREAD dealing with the front desk staff to the extent that I am now tempted in times of need (on days like today when my two boys are legitimately IN NEED of seeing a doctor) to go to Phx Children's Urgent Care In Shea off Scottsdale which is MUCH farther for me to go just so I will not need to deal with the appalling way the front desk folks treat me at this office. 

Today, I HAD an appointment. Gal didn't want to check me in bec I couldn't verify the phone number on file. I explained I've had multiple changes lately as my husband was arrested for domestic violence in June. 

""My kids are sick, they have been coming here since they were born. You have my id & my insurance cards. I really do not see what your issue is ...""

I proceeded to give her other identifying documents I happened to have on me including my autistic son's state id, my passport card, my passport book, 2 old driver's licenses in my old name (I had a court ordered legal name change), another driver's license in my new name, etc.

Then when I was checking out, I received even worse treatment. That same gal kept repeating over and over again that they would update my information AS SOON as possible in a patronizing manner. I didn't care about that AT ALL she was the one giving me such a difficult time. 

Then, another gal popped out and took my green check out file folder and asked if it was okay to use the card on file. I said ""Sure, but if you have a card on file, it may not work because as I have explained I had a name change and they left my card number the same but reissued it with the new name and a different expiration date and security code. 

In silence she walked to the computer w/no explanation. She came back to talk to the first gal who had given me such a hard time from the beginning telling  she had entered something incorrectly because my autistic son has no copay since his disability automatically comes w/a secondary insurance that covers it. 

So then she tells me I have no copay and that I am good to go. Knowing she is incorrect, I tell her that I owe a $30 or $35 copay. She wants to argue with me telling me I owe nothing. I explain that I have only 1 autistic son/other son is ""typical"" so he only has 1 insurance & I owe a copay on his account. I go on to say, ""Like I said earlier, you are free to use the credit card account on file.""

In the most condescending tone EVER, she says to me, ""WHAT I AM TELLING YOU IS, YOU HAVE NO CARD ON FILE!""

Me: ""Well, HERE IS THE CARD I WANT TO USE, RIGHT HERE."" (I am still holding it up ready to pay.) WHAT A JERK!",0,0,0

As I said in that review, I've been a Red Robin customer since the 80s from SoCA. After the recent experiences, I was pretty much done. Well, a dinner companion was craving Red Robin so I agreed to go along ... so long as we went to the ""other"" Scottsdale location.

What a relief! Clean as a whistle. 

Friday night. 6:30 p.m. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated in the dining room electing to not sit immediately in the bar. Friendly greeter. Friendly hostess seating us. Pretty prompt recognition from the server.

I ordered my usual gauc bacon burger ""with some pink."" And, my absolute go-to blended chocolate raspberry shake. 

The only hiccup, which was solved in mere moments was my co-worker had ordered sweet potato fries. They weren't served with the meal. But, the floor manager who'd brought the meals took care of it about as fast as a walk to the kitchen and back. Bravo.

She asked if everything looked okay as soon as we got our meals, but never asked us if we needed anything or if everything tasted okay, even though she continuously walked by the table, looked at our table, and kept walking. She also never asked if we were finished, but just brought our checks over without really saying anything while two of our guests were still eating. Overall just an awkward experience.

2,"A decent break from the contrived ""ambiance"" and pre-proportioned frozen food of the chain taverns or pubs (e.g. Applebees, TGIF, Red Robin). Had a burger and fries with a cold draft. Not a gourmet burger, but competent and pretty good quality. Fries were no more greasy and much more tasty than the local chains, and were served hot and crispy. Have not tried anything else on the menu yet. Decent selection of tap beer (e.g. Bud Light (yuk), PBR, Kilt Lifter) and it is good and cold. Prices are hard to beat. Burger is $3.75 and a hell of lot better than fast food and most chains.

I like the dark 70's era atmosphere for a change. Service was really good. The barkeep/waitress had a really sweet disposition and was attentive. A few bar flies, but not overwhelming. Just enough to add to the atmosphere with some ""non-pc"" chatter. Downsides; I like dives, but this place could use a good wipe down once a week or so. Not the place for someone that likes the consistency and plastic atmosphere of a chain or that may be sensitive to non-pc bar chatter. Hard as hell to find. No sign on the building and the entrance is not immediately apparent, it is located in a windowless building that looks like it might have housed a pawn shop or tax preparation service at one time.

1,"I personally do not love this place since the food isn't good here. The good thing about this place is its location and the very cheap pitchers of beers.

The burgers here are dryyy, I can taste the low grade beef being used in the patties here, they do have a nice smoky flavor though so I will give them that, the bun is your standard run of the mill bun, it isn't even toasted. Anyways do not expect great burgers here.The onion rings are huge but greasy and some times you get soggy ones -  not great.

The atmosphere is like a typical sports bar, lots of college students come here since the food isn't that expensive and the beers are pretty cheap for the area, I think a pitcher of PBR is about $10.

Service is usually pretty good, the waitresses check on you sporadically, but isn't intrusive. Overall, I can see why some people might like this place (eg for predrinking), but I am not really into that kind of thing, so for me I wouldn't come here unless my friends insist.",0,0,0

Place is packed with silk and the men who love them....to our amazement we were seated right away albeit next to the kitchen but oh well...

RA is a place for redefined sushi, tetaki, sashimi and assorted japanese style choices...we tried most of their specialty plates from the happy hour menu and a couple of signature rolls from the menu.  I tried to dislike the food, but, it's good!  And you cannot beat the prices for happy hour!  

Turns out the taping was a charity event for a young man battling cancer, proceeds from a special menu were being donated by RA.  Kudos for that!

3,"EXPENSIVE !!!
Expect to be paying about $5.50-$10 for ONE TACO.

I mean don't get me wrong, the tacos are pretty good, but DAMMM its expensive for such a small portion. They don't even use special taco shells, its just regular tortilla tacos.

Viva China Taco
(beef tendon/kumamoto oysters) $5.50

This taco was really unique. The beef tendon was dried and had the texture of really thin beef jerky. It was glazed in an asian flavor sauce. Served with ONE semi-raw oyster and seaweed. It was different but good.

Carnitas Taco $5.50
(braised baby pig, pork rinds, spicy salsa verde cruda)

This taco was basically filled with pulled pork. Topped with a spicy salsa that resembled spicy guacamole with chopped onions. Then two small pieces of pork rinds. It was good as well.

18 Monk Noodle $14.88
(hand cut wheat noodles, shiitake, crispy sweet potato, soy sauce)

Honestly, these noodles were kind of disgusting. First of all, it was a really tiny portion served in a large bowl. The noodles were completely over-sauced and drenched in soy sauce which made it salty. It was definitely not worth the price tag and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!

Overall, we bought one bowl of noodles, and three tacos, and the bill came out to about $50. Not coming back here again.",1,1,0

Last time the congee is a fair portion, but it was really salty.  Ironically, the salt-fish-chicken-cutlet-fried rice was amazingly bland and unsalted.  The salty-fish was used very sparingly and the dish lacked flavour.

Their choy is pretty standard, but heavy overuse on the garlic.

There must-try dish is the ""pepper & salt"" line - they have chicken wings, calamari, and some other ones.

The restaurant is located not far from the Laurier metro station. The weather was nice and as they have a really cute terrace, I've asked to be seated outside.

I was in the mood for red wine, as I didn't notice any from the menu, I asked the waitress about it and was given a glass without any explanations as to what kind of red wine it was, I assumed that they probably only had one kind and that it was their standard wine.

Then I wanted to order their lobster dish but there was none, I asked for something else and hum there was none either... So my only option left was fish and chips with cod, which I, unfortunately, did not find at my taste. The flavor of the fish was almost non-existent maybe because it was a little too greasy.

If I could describe Papa George in 2 words it would be Dickens lite.  Papa George is a nice HK style cafe to come for lunch or a very early dinner.

Pros:
Very friendly staff
Food quality is pretty good

Cons:
Small place
Hours are strange

If you've ever been to Dickens, Papa George will have a similar feel for you.  As soon as you walk in, there's a European feel to the place.  It feels like a small chalet nestled somewhere in France.  One think i notice it the clientele ranges from teens, families to the seniors.  Groups of all ages frequent this place. 

The place is rather small.  There are about 10 tables total and it's fairly busy most of the time. 
We had come twice before but it was so full that we had to go somewhere else.  One look at the menu and again I was reminded of Dickens.  We ordered the pan fried chicken steak with rice and the Portuguese chicken on pasta.  All meals come with garlic bread, soup and a drink here. (just like Dickens)

The food comes rather quickly which is nice.  My chicken steak is very nice.  I ordered the same thing at Dickens and it looks very much the same, right down to the sauce.  overall very good dish.  My GF's Portuguese chicken though, was more like a curry than Portuguese sauce.  Portuguese sauce should be a lighter coconut based curry.  When it's more curry it takes away from the dish.  It was still OK, but could of been better.  Another thing to note, the drink (like Dickens) is served at the end of the meal.  If you want it with your meal, you will have to tell the server.

The servers here are all very nice.  There were many regulars there the servers knew well and the conversations were almost like the servers were eating with them  They maintained good service while still mingling with regulars when they could very well. Another thing to note is the hours of this place.  They close at 8 which is early by HK style cafe standards.  If you want to have dinner here which I know I would, you have to have an earlier one.  It's a very strange hour to close for HK style cafes but it is what it is.

Papa George for me is basically Dickens with a smaller menu, space and hours.  It still does things very well though.  If it weren't for the hours, this would be an excellent choice for dinner.  If you're a fan of Dickens you should definitely give this place a try.",0,1,0

22,"I almost feel guilty doing this....but this is my honest opinion of this place...

I have to knock it down a star because of a few things..

- It is just too much production and not enough focus on Christ and the scripture. Seriously. It's one thing to have the band rocking out, the rapper, the glow sticks, the dancers etc as an opening to everything...but this literally takes up HALF the service! I didn't come here for all this mess. I came here to Praise God and Jesus! 

- Still overboard with the pandering for donations. I always give every time I go...gladly. But I don't necessarily want my money going to glowsticks and other nonsense like that when it could go to better causes..

I have figured out that it is best for me to just miss the first half hour of the service and show up halfway through..because I do appreciate Pastor Judd. I just wish there was more focus on the scriptures...it almost comes across as an afterthought here at times..


All that said, people are so nice and friendly here...I almost feel like my search for a good church for me still rolls on....

It is still A-OK..

0,"The name of this place caught my attention and then I saw ""sushi burrito"" and knew I wanted to try it.

I got the strawberry lemonade as my drink which was $4.50, but came in a mason jar with their logo on it a was served with fresh strawberries and lemons inside. The drink was a ok, but a little sweet and overpriced. The sushi burrito was really good and I would come back and order the exact same sushi burrito again because I enjoyed it. 



Negatives:
-I told the server that it was my first time visiting the restaurant and when I ordered the green tea rice as my base, he did not inform me that I could only get that base of ordering a bowl.

Positives:
-sushi burrito was great
-overall customer service was good with room for improvement 
-clean establishment


-I wanted to get some wasabi on the side, but that wasn't available when they were putting my order together and once I sat down I had to ask another server again if the wasabi was ready for him to place it on my table.

They're not trying to win awards for presentation and I wouldn't be shocked if one of the cooks was smoking a cigarette while cooking- but damn good, cheap pizza in Lachine!",1,2,0
1,"For the most part, I received great service at this store. The girl I had been dealing with was quite helpful and was able to track down the item I was looking for and order it in for me. The staff overall are friendly and welcoming.

I came here for one thing specifically... and ONLY because everywhere else I called around town weren't willing to, or couldn't, order it in for me but they seem to have a nice (yet limited) supply of mostly higher end gear and clothing.

I doubt very much that I would shop here again as there are other places which have a far greater selection for lower prices.

One thing I was certainly disappointed with was that they didn't honour the '10% off your purchase' check-in offer. The owner claimed to know nothing about it... I'm not quite sure how that would happen.",0,1,0
2,"Great place to eat a good pizza but there are some things that need to change.  La Piazza is in the heart of Old Town Glendale which is a nice change since most eateries in the Phx Metro are in stucco strip malls nearby a Walmart or Target.  We ordered a bunch of different entrees and one appy.

We started with a bottle of wine which was ok but not italian and was also capped and not corked.  I can deal with the not having  italian wine at an italian pizza restaurant but please have corked wine.  We moved on to the stuffed shrimp.  It tasted semi fresh but was a little charred on top due to being in the oven I think a little too long.  The garlic olive oil topping on the shrimp was very pleasant though.  For our mains we shared.  We had a Salvatore, an Italian Stallion, Chicken Marsala, and the Mediterranean Ravioli.  Both pizzas were good, the crust was fresh and the ingredients were good also but it did not wow me in any way.  I love good prosciutto but the Salvatore prosciutto did not have much taste and the parmesan did not have a lot of bite either.  The Stallion was the star pizza with some very good meat toppings.  The other star for me was the Mediterranean Ravioli.  The Ravs seemed to be freshly made and had a very refreshing taste that was not heavy at all.  My friend almost licked his plate clean of the Chicken Marsala which I did not try.

Overall it was a very good meal and if there was a 3.5 star option I would have given it to La Pizza.  It stacks up to Bianco, and Cibo but falls just a tad bit short due to some beverage, and appy choices.

If you are in the downtown Glendale area I would definitely recommend checking this place out.",0,0,0

1,"As I write this, I've only been here once which was a couple days ago.  It's a 24 hour BBQ place with decent meat.  (I Hear at night it's better).  If you're going to compare it to Korean BBQ buffets in California or NY then you're going to be surely disappointed because the meat is, of course, a lot better in terms of quality and price than here.  

However, if you're looking for a good late night eat that'll fill you up, this isn't too bad of a choice.  The grills are a bit small for a big party, but the people who served us here were really nice and always waited on us.  The decor could use a little more work.

5,"Went here on 6/5/14 with Yuhi K., Ardie Y. and Sho Y. for lunch. I've probably driven past this restaurant a zillion times and have never noticed it, but it's right across from the giant Vietnamese grocery store I shop at.

Unfortunately my phone self destructed the photos folder, so I have no pics to upload as the backup function also decided to self destruct. Wonderful!

Ardie ordered because I had never been here and he and Sho are regulars.

2 orders Xiaolongbao - I've never had xiaolongbao prior to this lunch. I did not like the dipping sauce that accompanied them because it had a strong white vinegar flavor. I have nothing to compare these to but I'd say they were okay.

1 order of pan fried pork buns - I definitely prefer the crispy, crunchy bread bao. Not much soup in them, but I preferred these to the steamed bao.

1 order stir fried string beans - I'm not much of a green bean person (I hate all beans, including jelly beans - always have) but these were pretty decent. It probably had more to do with the meat sprinkles. Mmm meat sprinkles. 

1 order Chinese broccoli - Also okay, no strong flavors either way. I'd say this was a neutral dish.

While everything I tried was staunchly ""A-OK"" I definitely want to come back to try the lamb. If a place has good lamb, I'll be a repeat for sure.

1,"The Plaza is haunted. I'm certain of this. You have to be in the right spot inside the hotel to feel it. 

It's not apparent in the recently remodeled casino. It's an old-fashioned casino, dim and dusky, rather than the brighter feel common in newer casinos. They have a poker room, really an area set off from the rest of the casino instead of a seperate room. The first hint that there are ghosts hovering at the Plaza is the classic and hard-to-find game of pan you can find being played in the poker room.

If you want to feel their presence more clearly, take the escalator up to the second floor and spend time at The Dome. The view of Fremont St. from the lounge's windows is an iconic Vegas image, and now the space has been augmented with the addition of a handful of televisions. It's a sportsbar-type theme now, you see. But spend even a few moments in here and you will feel what must've been many varied incarnations of the room. I imagine it was once a very glamorous restaurant. Now it's an underpromoted downtown vantage point.

The escalator ride to the third floor feels like a journey to a ghost town. There is a jerky store waiting to be explored with a selection of candies and flavored jerkies available. The third floor is also home to the only bingo room currently up and running in downtown Vegas. What may have once been a conference room is now home to dozens of folding tables. Here too, odd variations on the usual game are offered. The spirit of the room is casual and friendly: if you have a thing for bingo you might end up spending a lot of time here.

I haven't yet seen any rooms or suites at the hotel, so I can't speak to how they look or feel. But the place that feels most eerie to me is the open area between the casino and the food court on the first floor. The spirit of visitors past is almost palpable as you look thru the glass doors and out to Fremont St. When downtown was the most exciting part of Vegas, the Plaza must've been THE place to be. Today it feels lot like a relic trying to keep the old spirit alive.

One more thing: avoid the parking garage if you can. It's the most narrow, twisty thing I've ever had to drive thru.",2,7,0

Sushi was subpar, but expected, and most of the sauteed vegetables looked old. But they did have a large salad bar, and a variety of desserts. The red heating lamps annoyed me little, made everything seem way too similar. Lunch was definitely cheaper than dinner or brunch on the weekends.

1,"This is an a-ok bar / lounge space in Bally's. It's not really separate from the casino area, so you get all the people watching (always a plus) and slot machine noises (not so plus-worthy when it's competing with a DJ). In an attempt to be cool and hip, there's a DJ that spins. And there will be some drunk people that will dance. I'm pretty sure you can drop a small fortune on a reserved table if you were uber-concerned about getting a particular tiny table to sit at. But that's really all uncalled for as this is pretty much just a lobby bar / center bar place. It's like the Heart Bar in Planet Hollywood, but smaller. This is definitely not a place to go out of your way to visit. There's just, frankly, nothing noteworthy or special trip about it. But, if you're hanging at Bally's for other reasons, and have a hankering for a cocktail or a loud DJ or an overpriced drink, you should come here. The cocktail list was alright.

4,"I have a confession: I cheated on my long-term stylists. I usually get my hair colored at one place on the Strip and then cut at another place off-Strip. And between the two, I usually pay $250-300 (not including gas and travel time). So I looked on Yelp and found this salon just down the street from me. I picked Sam as my stylist based on the pictures I saw from Yelpers and her Instagram.

It was definitely a very different experience than what I've experienced at every other salon (here in Vegas and in other cities). It's not an upscale kind of place. It was, honestly, probably the messiest salon I've ever set foot in. It's got a cool-ish vibe with the blue walls and artwork. But it was still unkempt.

The stylists also behaved very differently. They sorta just lounged around and carried on conversations with each other across the salon. None were dressed nicely and none really had done their own hair. Just a whole different level of professionalism and presentation.

I was, frankly, surprised by how few questions Sam asked me. She was thorough, though, and took her time. I never felt rushed. And I did leave the salon feeling good about my hair. And I liked the blowout/style. Tip: Be sure to check-in on Yelp for 10% off.

But that said, the base color wasn't as bright as I'm used to and feels more brown. But the purple and pink do look great. And the color is even, no missed spots, no color mess on my skin, etc. The cut is decent. And I've already gotten numerous compliments. Sam definitely did a good job.

It's a significant savings and is just down the street from me. So big bonus points for that. And it not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the look of the salon and professionalism of the staff. It's just...different - not my usual experience.

I'm up for giving it another try and will go back to Sam again. She was pleasant and friendly and did a good job. And hey, when developing a new relationship with a stylist, it takes more than once to get comfortable, learn how your personal hair works, and get everything perfect. If you're looking for some color to your hair color (blue, green, pink, purple, etc.) this is definitely the place to go. It beat out my upscale Strip salon experiences in that way.",4,4,0
2,"I have been here about 10 times.  Once for lunch and the rest for dinner.  They have the best Fish and Chips.  It is lightly battered, the fish is moist, and the Tarter Sauce is awesome.  The challenge is they don't serve the Fish and Chips after 10 PM.  I was here last night and was denied their fish and chip deliciousness!!  We ended up going next door to San Tan Brewery and ordered the Fish and Chips there and it actually was pretty good.  

Fish and Chips is a signature dish for Irish Republic  and it is deep fried so I don't quite get why they would pull it off the menu at 10:00.  I have had a couple of servers that were awesome, but for the most part the service is slow and often times the server is not rude, but you get the impression that they have better things to do and your more of a burden than a customer.   Service and quality decline drastically if it is busy. 

In terms of drinks if you focus on something from the tap you will typically be okay.  If it is slow you will not have to much trouble with mixed drinks.  If it is busy, you will likely be disappointed with your mixed drink.  Typically it will be warm, half poured, and if you have anything with sugar on the rim (Lemon Drop) you will taste salt with the sugar.  If they were more consistent with their service, food, and drinks and did not sacrifice their quality when they are busy  I would give them a higher rating.",0,1,0

For a place called ""taphouse"", my husband, ever the IPA connoisseur, was unimpressed with the beer choices. I think he settled on Odells which is a good standby. The menu is ok and just ok. They have burgers and just regular old fare. I ordered shrimp tacos which were pretty good but my server failed to tell me that they came with a side so the side (baby kale) was delivered late to the table. My husband loved the burger and said that it is definitely worth visiting for that purpose alone. My wine (selected from a decent list of wines by the glass) came in a dirty glass - not just a little dirty but a how the hell did you let it out of the bar - dirty.

We came in and it took a little while for the people ahead of us to be seated and when they were the maitre d took a phone call instead and tried to help someone with a misplaced bracelet? Now, why do some  establishments preference people who call to someone who is either next in line or already being helped? I'll never get it. A good business would put the caller on hold. We decided to to sit down at the waiting area because I thought this might be the proper way to get help and plus my arms were getting tired of holding the baby in her car seat.

It's s good thing they wanted to sit at the bar, so it didn't take long for me to be seated when I stepped back to the line.

My server was just ok nothing above average. Didn't ask if we wanted more to drink from our skinny glasses of juice and smoothies, which I do have to commend them for their taste. The ribeye was supposed to be medium but seemed dry at the same time, maybe it was because of the sear. I would recommend medium rare if you like medium. The chilequilas were good and tasty. The salmon on the benedict was too salty but the poached eggs were done just right, especially the yoke. Not too dry and not too runny. And the pot bread is always good.

However service was not all too fantastic. Was not greeted as we came in the restaurant, servers took their time chatting before finally leading us to our table. We were sat and left with the menus for a good 10 minutes before we realized that no server was going to take our order unless we called for one. Our finished dishes were not taken, refills on water were only given twice: midway and after our meal. Guests who'd arrived later and were noticeably older and richer were served before us.

We'd ordered the Watermelon Poke as our appetizer, the Habibi salad and the Planta Burger. Place is perfect for Vegans and while nicely plated, the food was not to our taste. Place is not recommended for those (like us who are) used to savoury dishes. 
-Watermelon Poke was a great take on Poke Salad - basically replaced salmon with watermelon. 
-Habibi Salad was served fresh with fried couscous balls (as we were guessing?).

5,"This place is amazing! I have not one thing bad to say when it comes to their food. 

The first time I visited, I just ordered a French press and some beignets. Got the order of beignets first and after I had finished eating them, I noticed I had not gotten my French press. I proceeded to the counter and asked for one, and the girl behind the counter said I will bring it right out. Then, after waiting about 10 minutes and no coffee, I went back to the counter and again asked for the French press. The girl was responsive, and gave it to me in a togo cup since I did not want to wait any longer. Nothing wrong with a little slow service. 

Now, my real reason for giving this place a 3 star is the service for the second time I visited. I had looked online and saw that they had dinner options and proceeded to the store. Everything went perfect, besides the usual delay in food, roughly about 30 minutes ,but the server was nice enough to bring out some fries at no charge. After we got the good and finished eating. I went up to go look at some dessert items they usually have upfront. Our server was at the cash register so I also told him that I wanted to pay the bill for my food. He told me that he usually likes to bring the check out to the table, but can cash us out there. After I got the bill, about $31, I made the total $35, signed it and left the store. When I got to the parking lot, our server came out of the store and yelled across the parking lot staying, ""I am not going to include the tip in your total,  it's okay, I know I gave you guys bad service."" And when I said no please add the tip in the total, he rudely replied, "" No Thanks!"" And walked inside. 

I found this rude and unprofessional, chasing down customers in the parking lot. A tip is something that is not required, but is given for exceptional service. While the service was good, it was not the best service. So I gave a small tip, but I guess it's not good enough these days and people expect a generous tip regardless of the type of service provided.",2,1,0

1,"Why? Why is your turkey melt a cold sandwich with melted cheese?
This review is long overdue. I haven't been here for about 6 months, when I was pregnant. But, I have been eating a Crackers for years, since their original location opened and have always gotten decent tasting food. 
I guess my gripe is really with the menu. I very carefully selected the turkey melt from the menu because I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich. Unfortunately, I was a high risk pregnancy, therefore I followed my doctor's directions to a T! ""No cold meat"" due to the bacteria listeria that can be found in cold meats. So, by the time I got my sandwich I was starving and was most of the way through the first half when I realized the meat was cold. I asked my husband to make sure I wasn't crazy before I called the waitress over. Let me just say, I worked in the food industry for years and I don't like sending food back...
Anyway, the waitress told me the turkey melt is always cold.  What? Every restaurant in my life that I have ordered a melt, it is hot. I felt ridiculous sending half of a sandwich back to be heated, but I wasn't eating it cold. She had to ask her manager what to do. Luckily, someone the kitchen was nice enough to make me half of a real turkey melt.

2,"Let me start by saying that I am an ice cream addict. I've been to my share of ice cream shops so when it comes to ice cream, I may be a little picky. When I saw Golden Cow Creamery on yelp and its great reviews, I knew I had to try it next time I was in Charlotte. 

This is a very small shop with limited flavors, space, and seating. They have a table of 2 people and 2 benches in the shop all spread out and some outdoor seating. Much more of grab and go place in my opinion. Since I went with a group of people, it was a bit awkward. I like that for every scoop sold in store, they give a portion of proceeds to a local charity. 

I got 2 scoops, strawberry and lavender honey, in a waffle cone. There isn't much difference between 1 scoop and 2 scoop so unless you want more than 1 flavor, definitely get 1 scoop! Strawberry was good and sweet. I wasn't too happy about lavender honey. It was just very bland and didn't have much taste to it. I ended up throwing away half of lavender honey and I NEVER throw ice cream away! But I kept the waffle cone because it was that good!

Bane, our hostess was very nice and friendly and made sure more than once that we were fine .
Nothing to say on the food - my hubby and I both had the spicy chicken burger - which is actually not spicy at all, is was a good portion, cooked well, filling but not too heavy.

6,"Calling all Vegans, Gluten Free's, Vegetarians and those who enjoy eating healthy. Nourish is probably your Garden of Eden. Hidden within the Optima, Nourish is a health food fan's paradise. The environment is fresh and clean and so is the food. 

Upon walking inside, I noticed how calm and refreshing the restaurant was. Everyone had the same calm attitude and I could tell that this is a restaurant you visit to relax and still feel healthy when you leave. The menu is detailed but not overwhelming. The only overwhelming part was trying to decipher what each icon indicated and soon I learned that most of the food is gluten free, vegan, vegetarian or some other food lifestyle other than carnivore. But, for those not following an alternative food lifestyle, it's still incredibly tasty and makes me rethink my cuisine decisions! 

Nourish serves breakfast all day (bonus) as well as lunch. It's a great brunch spot. The eggs Benedict is spot on. I can't tell what sort of herb or tweak they add to the hollaindase sauce but it doesn't taste like your typical eggs benedict. Their breakfast sandwich is tasty as well but a little bit more on the dry (and healthy) side. Their ingredients are fresh as is their produce. If they push the cinnamon roll on you it's because it's like a cinnamon god's protege and worth every calorie consumed. Plus it's flowing with frosting. 

Nourish has a great patio for dining as well as spacious seating inside, but the patio is covered enough that even on a hot day it's comfortable to sit outside. 

So in summary, Nourish is a good choice if you're looking for a healthy meal that will fill you up. I will absolutely be back and I can't wait to try some of the lunch items that looks tasty. 

Note: Be sure to check the times before visiting Nourish. I was surprised to find out that they open at 11:00 on Saturdays but 9:00 on Sundays.",2,4,0

4,"This was an interesting dinner.  Yes, our party was 20-21 people deep.  Yes, four of those people tried to eat a 3-ish pound bowl of pho.  The other interesting thing at Pho 87 is the hostess.  She has the kind of humor where she'll insult you to your face throughout the night without so much as cracking a smile...it may work for some, others not so much.  For myself I wasn't particularly in the mood for the peanut gallery that night (much less from our server), but I can see myself getting a kick out of it on a different day.

Food pricing seemed kind of steep; pho comes in four sizes: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=MLarFzHf2ilmdTVc5_ek7w.  For the most part it was along the lines of $7.00 for small, $8.00 for medium, $9.00 for large & $30 for the challenge.  Pho is just okay, broth was nothing special.  Noodles were good but nothing to make me crave Pho 87.  We also tried some spring rolls, of the pork (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=S1gDi5mmQgkydd-blLzV2Q) and shrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/m51uL1LZhKYf2y_yG4NEng?select=l8tBxk3n206Gl4MufktExQ) varieties.  Pork seemed tasty, but you only get a tiny sliver of meat in each roll.  Shrimp wasn't anything special, but again, very little shrimp inside.

12,"I'll start by saying that if you are looking for a quick massage during your lunch hour, this spa will do the trick.  The therapists are qualified and welcoming.  However, if you are looking for an actual 'spa' experience, this isn't the place to choose.  

Its a teeny tiny little operation in a vanilla brick office building.  The space includes two interconnected treatment rooms, a waiting room that doubles as the receptionist's work space, and no showers.  Not a good spot for a ladies spa day (which is why my Mom and I went), don't expect to be able to lounge anywhere before or after treatment.  And yes, I did inform the receptionist when booking that this was our plan.  She offered to add a wine and cheese plate to our experience, but honestly I have no idea where we would have enjoyed it -- in the space next to her desk?

I think our biggest let down was the way the package we booked was billed:  it was supposed to be a 90 minute hot stone massage, a 'gemstone' facial, and a special foot treatment.  They actually combined all three treatments at once -- doing the foot treatment at the same time as the 'facial'.  The quotes are because the gemstone facial was not a facial -- it was a face massage with a very thick hydrating cream.  We both kept waiting for someone to return, remove the cream, and continue with the 'facial'.  Not at all what we expected.  

At the end of our treatments, the only people left in the 'spa' were ourselves and our therapists, and since the marketing and booking of services isn't really their job, we didn't make a fuss.  We did both agree that the massage part of our experience was well done and relaxing.  But that being said, we wouldn't return.",2,1,0

When you sit down, they give you a menu with lots of options, but the one you want is the one in the little standee on the table.  In addition to $4 steak and eggs, they also have $1-$3 breakfasts, which is as good a deal as you could ask for.

2,"My girlfriends and I were deaf for a week after Body English. The music is good but way too loud. Apparently this is the place to go on a Sunday night, even for locals. It was kind of annoying bc there was no real line outside, more like a haphazard crowd, so it took longer than usual to grab someone to let us girls in. They place got really packed, but there was still enough room to dance our tushies off. The bar was just completely unreachable, so I recommend alternative sources of inebriation.

Oh, and I almost forgot - apparently hosts here BOOK GIRLS for tables. I have never experienced this in my entire freaking life and frankly I was appalled and disgusted. We walked in and someone asked us if we wanted a table, so we thought it was a ladies perk. He brought us to some table and told us we could drink there. We were confused bc there were already people at the table, but then he started handing us glasses. Anyhow, apparently he didn't realize that there were guys with us so when he saw them, he snatched the glasses out of our hands and told us to leave before we even realized the table belonged to someone else. Apparently the guy that booked the table sends out his host to scout for groups of girls for him to drag back. GEEZ. Are you that desperate? and SO incompetent that you can't talk to girls on your own? Thinking about it again makes me really angry bc the situation was handled in such an insulting and unprofessional manner. We are not girls who try to flirt our way to free drinks, so don't treat us like such. To offer something in a misleading manner and then to be so disrespectful was just really unacceptable. 

I would have enjoyed my experience more if that hadn't happened right when we walked in. So between that and being deaf for a week, this place gets a 3 star rating. I'd probably come back, with earplugs (and maybe pepperspray), but only on a Sunday night.",1,0,0

1,"This restaurant caused my boyfriend and I to get into an argument over whether preferring your burger well-done was wrong. He claims preferences can't be wrong. I claim they can. Examples of wrong preferences include: Preferring Hitler to Kittens, preferring Miley Cyrus to The Beatles, and preferring a 1/2 pound ground beef patty to be dry and tasteless as opposed to juicy and delicious. It's just wrong.

If, however, you are one of those who ""prefer"" well done burgers, like really, really well done burgers, Smashburger is the place for you.  It also helps if you prefer long wait times and cold fries. I would consider these preferences to be ""wrong"" as well, but who am I to say? It appears Smashburger has found a niche of followers with preferences very different from my own.

I realize that this location has just recently opened, so I'm going to cut them some slack with regards to the ""5-7 minute wait time"" that turned into 25. The employees did seem like they were working hard. The food window was extremely backed up while we were waiting in line to order, which made me nervous that our burgers would spend 10 minutes under a heat lamp before we received them. However, the staff seemed to catch up before our order was ready. Which makes it even weirder that my burger still tasted like it sat under a heat lamp for 10 minutes.

I'm being generous with my star rating because it may have been an off night, and I've heard some good things, but I can't see myself gambling with giving it another shot. I walked in craving a good burger, I left $24 poorer (for 2 people) and craving a good burger. Wrong.",4,2,0

4,"Not so long ago, Downtown Phoenix was something of a sushi desert with Moira as the lone option for area residents.  I knew of Moira and had passed by their establishment numerous times, but had avoided taking the plunge largely as a result of a lackluster reviews.  In the years since, Harumi Sushi (my pick for the best in Downtown) and Squid Ink Sushi have joined the fray and have largely delivered a good product to the masses.  Recently I noticed that Moira had expanded their outdoor patio to accommodate what appears to be a growing customer base.  Given my love of sushi and these encouraging signs of growth, I finally (after 5 years of living just a stones throw away) set foot in Moira for the first time on a Saturday evening.

On the bottom floor of the 215 McKinley Condos (on the southwest corner of 3rd Street and McKinley), you can't miss Moira's outdoor patio.    The patio seats about 25 while the inside of Moira's long narrow space can pack in about 50.  The dim lights, concrete floors, and dark facade certainly don't hide the fact this is an urban restaurant.  But the aesthetically pleasing lantern lights and segmented seating options (the sushi bar being front and center) set Moira apart from Squid Ink and Harumi with the feel of a neighborhood haunt.  I grabbed my spot at the sushi bar and was provided menus of food and beverages to study right off the bat.

To start with, I was looking for a good Japanese beer.  The Kawaba Sunrise was an intriguing option as I love a good Amber Ale.  And indeed it was a smooth refreshing and not too heavy starter to my evening.  For my appetizer, I ordered their Kara-age.  Fried chicken bites covered in seaweed, chili powder, and sea salt on a bed of cabbage.  It comes with what tastes like a sort of honey mustard sauce mixture.  Think of these as a slightly brinier, slightly more tender version of your standard chicken nuggets.  Decent starter and the sauce was good, though perhaps would've preferred a little more crunch.  For my main entree I was torn as to what to get so I asked the waitress what were their most popular sushi rolls.  Without hesitation she said the Sun Devil was the fan favorite here (and given ASU's Downtown campus is just a few blocks south of here, that makes perfect sense).  So I jumped on the bandwagon.  Tempura shrimp, crab, avocado, tuna, aioli, eel sauce, and topped with sliced jalapeños.  The mixture of sauces and fish were great and the jalapeño spice notes mixed in quite well to give it a good punch.  But I do have an important compliant to register on this.  The rice.  It was too dry.  Rice with just the right moisture content can compliment and accentuate the flavors of the fish, but the dry texture of the rice on this one took away from the fish in my opinion.  Maybe a one time snafu, but an unfortunate one.

Total cost for the beer, food, tax and tip came to about $40.  One thing I will compliment Moira for tonight was prompt and friendly service.  This would seem to be a given at any restaurant worth their name, but I'd noticed a number of Yelpers had logged complaints about their service experience here.  I had no issues whatsoever on the service front.  On the food side however, I would say my experience was just okay.  Cool setup and convenient for Downtown residents and visitors alike, but probably third in the Downtown sushi pecking order as of me writing this review.  I'll come back if things continue to improve, but for now I would still give Harumi my recommendation as Downtown's top sushi destination.",2,2,0

For two people we ordered: pork soup buns (XLB), Shanghai noodles with cabbage and pork, veggies (gai lan) with pork and the beef pancakes. I would say the only redeeming factors were the XLBs and the beef pancake, those were authentic and yummy. However the noodles and the veggies with pork were pricey for the amount of food you got and it was quite oily. I feel like I could have cooked the noodles and veggies at home myself and it would have tasted the same.  For the 4 dishes, we paid about $50 after tax and tip. 

Service was typical of what you would get at Chinese restaurants, speedy but not over the top. Would I return in the future? Yes, but I would probably order more of their dim sum type foods instead of noodles and stir fry dishes.",0,0,0

The not yummy:
Shrimp rolls in rice paper (didn't taste that fresh, and the dipping sauce tasted mostly of oyster sauce)
Pho (bland)

My pizza arrived as a completely different pizza, but the waitress offerred to remake it immediately and even brought me a nice salad so I could eat with my family while their meals were hot.  She packaged my pizza to go.  The best item was a sampling of their sliders which my husband ordered.

I was disappointed that this location does NOT offer a Military Discount.

While waiting, I noticed a gumball machine, stacked high chairs, and a large garbage can in the hallway to the restroom.  It was just difficult to get through to the restroom.

I ordered the Seafood Combo with BBQ Short Ribs ($9.15) and 2 Spam Musubi ($2.25 each).  It took less than 10 minutes to get my food.

The 3 breaded shrimp were butterflied with the tails on.  They were really dry, not juicy.  The breaded mahi mahi filet was small and also thin and dry,  The BBQ Short Ribs were sweet and a little tough and fatty on top a large portion of raw cabbage.  There were 2 scoops of rice in the box.  The macaroni salad was in a 5 1/2 plastic cup.  It had too much mayonaise.

The Spam Musubi were warm.  They were seasoned with a sweet soy sauce.  I would order them again.

3,"I was walking by and the sweet smell of ""Chinese"" food captured me. I went for the buffet because I was pretty hungry. Now, for a fair warning, this is not real Chinese food because nearly everything was deep-fried candy General Tso's and imitation crab ragoons. I knew what to expect, that is why I am giving this place three stars. You know when sometimes for breakfast you get the itch to go order a bunch of donuts even though you should be eating 2 slices of 100% whole wheat bread? It was kind of like that since I hadn't eaten this kind of crap in a while. It fulfilled the indulgence. So, pretty much what I saw were all the American classics like General Tso's chicken, Sweet and Sour pork, beef and broccoli, and some others with some steamed and fried rice. Most of it tasted pretty horrible, as was to be expected, but I rather enjoyed the General Tso's chicken and the fried rice.

It's not the classiest of joints, but what can you really expect for $7.50? The waitress gave pretty good service (she seemed sweet too)

0,"First off I think the decor is beautiful and it is much more spacious than the Banh Mi Boys Queen St location. Luckily when I went there it wasn't busy so I ordered right away without having to wait in long line ups. The menu seems quite similar to the BMB menu with some differences. The wait times was typical of how long you have to wait at BMB. I got the bulgogi cheese steak bao and rice balls while my husband got the fried oyster bao and pork belly lo mein. You get to choose how hot you want your bao which is medium-shiracha, hot-jalapeño and very hot- habanero peppers. I got the very hot and well it was not even medium hot so I had to add more shiracha. The bulgogi cheese steak didn't have much cheese in it but a good ratio of meat to bao. The flavour of the beef was your typical bulgogi flavour and it was very tender. The rice balls was a little disappointing because there were barely any sausage pieces in it. The only thing that saved it was the mayo and bonito flakes. I had to drench the rice balls with shiracha for a kick of flavour. My husbands fried oyster bao was way better, very crispy and flavourful. I would probably get the oyster bao myself next time. The lo mein was basically ramen noodles with 2 slices of pork belly. Holly, the pork was too salty and the noodles were  lacking flavour. Out of everything I tried I thought the baos were the best. I will definitely come back but hopefully the second time around they will bump up the spice and quality of their food. Hopefully they will bring something new to the menu that isn't reminiscent of the BMB menu.",0,0,0

At the entrance, a large glass showcase of readily made gourmet sandwiches, pastries and salads were prepared for the on-the-run crew. Looked healthy! Mouth watering!  Service was great - responsive, tentative, and warm.

Free Run Turkey Burger ($16) was prepared with condiments of tempura onion, avocado and a dill pickle mayo sauce. It came with a few vegetable chips on the side.  The chips were thickly cut and quite hard, requires strong teeth to tear it apart.  However, it was not oily at all and seasoned with adequate amount of salt.  I quite liked it for a different texture and has a sweet taste to it, while absorbing the fiber and nutrients.  No surprise from the burger.  The turkey patty was tasty and juicy, while the sauce was not very distinct.  It was quite a generic burger, despite having the jazzy ingredients.

Roast Duck Poutine Pizza ($16) was made curds, fries, duck, and accompanied by the recommended nasty sauce on the side.  The nasty sauce was an attractive sour and very spicy sauce.  The first sample of the sauce was bearable, but the more you try it, the more if feels like your tongue had gone on fire.  The pizza was a successful combination of two comfort foods.  With a thin crust and a lot of toppings, the pizza was baked just about right to be crunchy and crispy.  The juices all retained to make the pizza extremely flavourful and fun to eat.  Not too complicated or overwhelmed by the burst of toppings~

Huge potion sizes, we could barely finish it.  For an early Sunday brunch, I enjoyed the lightness of the meal, and little oil.  The environment was just great and relaxing, with quite a bit of privacy to feel comfortable.",0,0,0
1,"I frequent this location the most often and for good reason! The Subway is conveniently located to my home, but the great customer service is what makes this my favorite store. I visited on Saturday evening around 7 PM and I was the only customer.  I was promptly greeted and the cashier was very friendly. He graciously let me change out my sub bread when I saw a flavor I wanted to try (jalapeño flavor! ) without a peep. He also answered all the questions I had with a smile.

I ordered a sub with a veggie patty, which I love because it's more substantial than the veggie delite. It's a great option for vegetarians,  although it is on the more expensive side (as all ""fake"" meat is).

Did not contain any dim sum choices and the americanized dishes they did serve were sub-par. Sushi rice was not very fresh. Was expecting a bit more in the way of small plates that I heard so much about but there were only a couple choices that were worth trying. 

A few good things: the bone marrow is definitely a cool and unique experience. The cold shrimp and crab legs were pretty fresh. The seafood stew station was nice.

Once we sat down at our table, we ordered some appetizers and then did not see our waitress again for a drink order for too long... A repeated theme... She cut people off while placing orders so I had to wait for her to come back to add a side to my order. Then she had the hardest time diving the bill as we wanted to pay for a friend who was celebrating a birthday. 

As far as the atmosphere and food! 5 stars. Everything we had was amazing. From French toast for dinner to an open faced pork sandwich on jalapeño cornbread to a tuxedo board of meat and cheese.

Xiao long baos (one crab meat and one pork) - dim sum portion? Each order only came with 4 pieces! Wished we ordered more! The skin and broth were spot on! Skin not too thick, not too thin. The broth was light and tasty. 

Pan fried dumplings - overstuffed with minced pork! The skin was perfectly pan fried. Be sure to ask for some black vinegar or hot sauce for dipping! 

Beef wraps - a bit underdressed. It can definitely use more hoisan sauce. The scallion pancake wrap was too dry and plain for my taste. Not on par to other shanghainese restaurants in gta I've been to. 

Braised pork belly - so much fat... My father in law loved it. But a mouthful of grease just isn't my thing. I cut out the leaner portion for a taste. Too chewy and  dry without the melt in your mouth fat. 

Beef noodle soup - yum the beef brisket was perfectly made! Juicy, tender, fell right apart in your mouth! Loved the texture of the house made noodle especially with all the broth each strand had soaked up! 

Shanghainese stir fried noodle - not overwhelmingly oily or salty! For once this dish didn't grease or salt me out. One of my fav of this meal! 

Garlic Dau Miu - the only veggie dish my brother in law would eat. A classic done well. Get this if you are looking for some greens to complement your meal! 

Fried Mantou with condensed milk - they pan fry one side rather than deep frying the whole bun. They also watered down the condensed milk. Overall It felt cheaply made, I recommend skipping. 

Overall - mostly good but nothing memorable enough to convince me to go out of my way for the food. I will probably stick to checking out the food court in this mall instead.",1,1,0

2.The blinds were not automatic which was a pain.

After checking in I called the front desk and they said that the 'strip view' is something that they do not guarantee and they no longer have automatic blinds in any of the rooms.
My only complaint would be that they should seriously consider updating the website and mentioning that even if you book a room with a view  it is not guaranteed (she said it was a request that they may/may not honor depending on availability)

Also if you need housekeeping you have to request for it,something we were blissfully unaware of so we ended up with an unmade bed (not that I cared or did I)

For food, my boyfriend ordered the lemon curd blueberry pancakes and I had the spam and eggs which also came with banana pecan pancakes (For $9.95, such a great deal). I thought the spam and eggs was just okay - you could never go wrong with spam but the rice wasn't what I expected. On the other hand, the pancakes were delicious. I preferred the banana pecan pancakes over the lemon curd, but it's only because I thought it was too lemon-y.

The lobster pizza we shared was disappointing.  Others found it very salty, I was simply unimpressed.  The crab cakes were average.

Open for less than a month, The Cuppa is a cool new coffee spot in the Gramercy Plaza off of Russell near Fort Apache.  Currently, there is a ton of construction going on Russell Road so it's only one lane in each direction.  I exited the 215 and had to turn around at Fort Apache to get here, but once I was here, it was fine.  However, I had a short visit because I arrived 30 minutes before they closed on a Friday afternoon. 

Right now, business hours are Monday-Friday, 6:00am-4:00pm, Saturday and Sunday, 7:00am-2:00pm.  Hours will probably be extended once business picks up per Charlie, the tall, personable barista/cashier.

I liked my drink and the chat I had with Charlie while I was there.  Lots of seating available in a nice, open space.  They offer pastries, cookies, bagels, sandwiches, along with coffees, smoothies, and teas.  The also offer free wi-fi if you want to plug in while you sip or chew.

My brother is a pretty regular customer here, and even has a discount card (for 10%), but I can only recall ever being here once before!  However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the lunch specials. 2 big pork chops with a bowl of rice and a lemon tea for $7.99? Hellz yea! I mean, the lemon tea ended up a lime tea that was over-sweet, but I guess I can just ask for less sugar next time.

1,"Okay so i'm sort of mixed on this place and that's why I gave it 3 stars and i'll tell you why in a second. So I want to make clear i'm not reviewing the Butcher Shop i'm reviewing the Road Kill Grill. So I only ever really come to this place once in a blue moon and I've had really good experiences and really bad. The food is great and the service is fast, they really get you in and out in a jiffy. However it sort of depends whose working the food counter. I've gotten sick from their Mac & Cheese before and ended up getting food poisoning but I've gone back and had great meals. This past meal that I had was fantastic, fresh, well prepared, and delicious.  I guess it sort of depends on what time of day you go. The time that I got sick I went close to closing (they are only open till 6pm and I went around 5pm) and the time that I went when I had a great meal was around lunch time. I guess it just depends on when you go. Otherwise a decent restaurant for a decent price.",0,0,0

5,"We stayed here for four nights during the Life is Beautiful Festival this year. It was convenient; just half a mile from festival grounds (15 minutes walking). I would have liked to be closer to the festival, but it was MUCH better than driving almost 40 miles daily if we had to commute from our house. Also, a family friend received the room comped, so we didn't have to pay the inflated prices that weekend.

The room was pleasant. No view worth noting. The two queen beds were comfortable and seemingly clean. I usually have a difficult time sleeping anywhere but my own bed, but these beds were nice. I was surprised that the windows had plantation shutters and it made it easy to allow the sunlight in when necessary. The air conditioning unit, located under the windows, was sufficient and not loud. The TV was okay - the picture quality was meh. Fortunately, we didn't need the television. There was a desk and the chair was comfortable. The toilet and shower had its own separate room while the sink and closet area was separated from the main room with a wall. The shower had good water pressure and the toiletries were decent. 

Access to the hotel floor via the lobby elevators worked well and was always efficient. They're also located right next to the front desk and garage elevators. The hotel guests are mostly older people, so it was always quiet and drama-free.

We received two booklets of Aloha Coupons that we used at Market Street Cafe and California Club Snack Bar. Nothing extravagant, but comped meals are always nice when you don't want to fuss too much about a quick breakfast or late night meal.",2,1,0

8,"I'm fairly new to Aspinwall and have enjoyed trying all of the different places around here.  Tavern in the Wall is the type of business that Aspinwall needs -- casual bar/restaurant where you can grab a brew and a bite, watch your Steelers/Pens/Pirates/whoever games, and generally just have a good time. 

I enjoy Tavern in the Wall as a bar.  They have some great drink specials, friendly staff, and free live entertainment on many weekends.  The owner also seems like a nice guy.  As a restaurant, however, it's sorely lacking.  The food, I hate to say, definitely resonates as your typical blah, not-horrible-but-not-great bar food.  That would be completely fine with me if Tavern in the Wall acted like a bar serving bar food.  But their food is priced like they believe they are a legit dining destination -- seriously, $10 for a fried zucchini appetizer? For reference, the high-end Joseph Tambellini restaurant across the bridge in Highland Park charges $9 for fried zucchini. $17 for pasta with sauce? Again, just to put that in perspective, Girasole in Shadyside charges $13. Based on the ""bar quality"" of The Tavern's food, their prices definitely need to come down to Earth and be more in line with the type of food they serve....either that, or they need to up their game quality-wise and change their bar vibe to more of a nice restaurant vibe to justify the price.  

So, in sum, if you're looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink, definitely give Tavern in the Wall a try...but if all you're in the market for is a great dinner, I'd look elsewhere.",0,1,0

Tom yum Kung: 3/5 stars. Good flavor. 

Spicy fried rice: 3/5 stars! we had the soup brought out to us first at a level 2 like the server suggested even after I told her that I can eat really spicy foods. Wasn't spicy enough so I had her tell the kitchen to make the rest of the order a level 3/5. Her response, ""well they already made the fried rice, but I can tell them to make your pad see ew spicier."" 

Hm...so then I have to add the Sambal and other spices by myself? But then it won't taste the same. Irritating.

Pad see ew: 2.5/5 stars. Bland! 

Mango sticky rice (sauce on side) : 5/5 stars! Bomb! Rice came out fresh and warm, mangos were also fresh with great flavor!

The bartenders were more interested in talking to their friends sitting at the bar then other patrons. One of the bartenders actually walked off the bar and sat on a chair in the middle of the shift. I had to flag the bartenders down for refills on empty beers, even after they sat empty in front of me for a couple minutes. The bartenders had no clue about the menus or specials and couldn't answer any of my questions... One of which was ""do you have any drink specials?""
The food was average bar food. Nothing special, and again the bartender couldn't answer any of my questions on the food like ""how is the WW II sandwich"". They were utterly stupid.

1,"Today was not my first visit to this location or to even P.F. Changs I have finally decided to give this location a review. 

Atmosphere: The outside of the restaurant was clean and well kept. The landscape was well maintained. The inside was warm and inviting and clean. The shades were drawn which was a plus as the sun was well the sun and it was shinning brightly through the windows. The atmosphere gets 4 stars

Service: We were greeted immediately and were given a warm welcome. As soon as we were seated and I mean before our backsides even fully hit the chair or waitress was giving us menus and telling us it was happy hour. Our drinks came out quickly. Myself and my significant other both ordered an appetizer. Their soup came out long before my appetizer did. He was finished for about 5-8 minutes before my appetizer came out. That was a little disappointing. Our glasses were never left empty. Service gets 3 stars.

Food: I opted to try what was called the tempura poppers. It was cheese and onion stuffed sushi that was tempura battered and fried. They were actually impressive in both display and flavor. I would definitely order them again. My significant other ordered a cup of egg drop soup. This however has significantly decreased in size. I tatsed it and it was far from P.F. Chang's quality, it was luke warm watery chicken broth with some carrots and onions. Not impressed. For my entree I choose the Chang's spicy chicken. My significant other ordered the Kung pao chicken in their new double portion. Yes the king pao was a decent size for the 25.00. My chang's chicken was ok. Much smaller of a portion than what it used to be. The problem that was off putting is that both entrees tasted like the gas flame that the food was cooked over and actually almost over powering.  The food just is not what it used to be and this is saddening. It wasn't awful to the point that we won't be back but there is definitely room for improvement. The food will be awarded 3 stars.

7,"This restaurant has a unique concept that I enjoyed up until the middle of eating our mains. But let me back track to the beginning...

We arrived early for our 8:15 pm reservation, there was a washroom for you to use ahead of time so you didn't have to get up during your meal. There were some tables and chairs to let you sit and choose your meal: choice of app + main OR all 3 courses. They also serve alcohol that can be ordered at the bar. After choosing our food, which they are very accommodating when it came to any substitutions which I really like when it comes to trying out new places (""How accommodating are they to people who request a change in their dishes?""). 

Next we then line up and wait in front of the door to lead us in (asked to put any watches that light up/glow away and turn our phones off), we put our hands on each other's shoulders like a train to follow our waiter (Dave) inside. It is completely pitch black, and it was a major adjustment. You have to trust the server to lead you, and it is all part of the experience. After being seated, we are told to feel where our table utensils are and where our water/plates/napkin is. I think the hardest part for me was buttering the bun...I doubt I even put any butter on it. The appetizers we had were the grilled octopus and calamari with tomatoes, and our mains were the steak and the fish with sides. I ditched my fork around the time I was eating my calamari, I would try to get pieces with my fork and try and eat it...only to find nothing. So after ditching my fork I was able to find all the yummy pieces. Besides...not like anyone can see me. I preferred the octopus to my calamari, which just tasted rubbery. My main was the steak- I got it rare. It was so good, and I loved that they cut it up for me already. So eating was a breeze. It was exciting when you feel like you've eaten all your steak then feel around and find more! There was plenty of potato mash left over on all of our plates-good but wish there was more veggies/ green beans (and bigger beans) instead.

 There are other people inside this dark room with you...this is where the dining experience started to be uncomfortable for me, as I can only speak for myself not the other people I was with. I think they were a table of maybe 5-6 people(?) who were just absolutely obnoxious, loud and disrespectful to other fellow diners in the room. They felt that they were allowed to swear/use inappropriate language, turning on their phones/turning their watch on and knocking on the walls. It just got super uncomfortable for me, they were goofing off- which is okay because we're all there to have a good time. But the middle of eating our mains I got really fed up when one of us were talking and the room would go silent and it was obvious the other group was listening in on our conversation. Then would make comments on their end that related to what we were talking about. I hate eavesdropping, it's one of my pet peeves. I requested to use the washroom and went outside to speak to the hostess about the other guests. She didn't really care it seemed, she just told one of the girls to make sure they weren't using their phones. I understand it wasn't any of the restaurants fault, and I enjoyed all of the food and experience. It's just a shame that other guests have to be so obnoxious and ruin the experience for others. Our server Dave was awesome, and big ups to him for being so nice and happy. We ended up requesting our dessert to be packed to go, it was just uncomfortable inside due to the room feeling smaller then it probably was. 

Good concept, good food, good company and awesome server.

The total amount of time spent at the restaurant was about 40 minutes, and had no memorable moments at all, but a grumpy waitress.

I arrived early and sat at the bar where I had the Goats Breast Milk - delicious! Once a couple of us arrived, we ordered the hummus, spicy feta, and tzatziki trio which was absolutely delicious minus the fact that we had to place TWO extra orders of pita to have enough. That turned it into an extremely expensive side for what it was.

Once we were finally seated, about 20 mins after our table was supposed to be ready, we continued to sit for another 10-15 until we got service. The waitress was sweet but she stopped by our table maybe 3-4 times the entire night so we felt we were asking for a lot every time she decided to stop by (drinks, silverware, even the basics). We really loved the half chicken and pork shoulder...the flavors were outstanding. My friend was not so lucky with the lamb - it looked like something i would give my dog it was so dry and overcooked. The beet side was excellent. Unfortunately, the mac n cheese and potato gratin were both extremely dry, bland, and disappointing which left me and my friend with a meat-only meal.

When the time came for dessert, we let the waitress know it was our friends birthday and she informed us that ""Kid Cashew doesn't do anything for birthdays"" but she could bring us a candle if we wanted. Really?!?! After spending $75 on a hit and miss meal you can't even give a girl a dessert? After debating taking the candle and sticking it in the potato gratin of Death Valley, we sucked it up and ordered the heath bar chocolate gelato which helped sweeten our bitterness over the lack of service and dry food.

I was pissed to say the least. This review started @ 1 star. I raised it to 3 because the staff actually found me a very comfortable seat on the same flight... and I was able to get out quickly. The flight attendants were really nice and courteous.

So? I was happy.",0,0,0

I couldn't wait for an hour (and you know it would have been longer) with my three kids in a waiting room that was packed.  Well I was at the office today for an hour and a half.

So keep in mind I prefer the southern flavor more. Having said that:

I had the butter chicken. It came out in a reasonable amount if time. I also ordered butter naan. The buttered chicken was sweet with very little heat. As the only white guy in the pace maybe they assumed I wanted mild. That was disappointing. Yet it did have a nice rich flavor and texture. The Baan was normal, good.

If I go back I will offer the tika masala and be sure to indicate my spice level. But still disappointed the southern India restaurant closed.",0,0,0
0,"TLDR: It could be better. The building blocks for awesome flavor are definitely there, but it doesn't seem like they're getting put together properly, and right now the food is just kinda bland. 

I ordered the tofu rice bowl. The tofu is fried with a lovely skin on it and topped with a very nice sauce. However, beyond those, the tofu had very little flavor, and it was very moist. I would have liked to see it lightly marinated or some moisture pressed out of it. Plus there wasn't nearly enough of that awesome sauce.

The bowl was topped with steamed broccoli and carrots (neither seasoned), a very well made ramen egg (this is NOT a vegan dish unless you explicitly request it), and some very tasty pickles (I think it was a root vegetable of some sort, but I didn't ask). The rice was boring old white rice.

There were a bunch of amazing elements to this dish that I absolutely loved, but they were muted by the very bland tofu, rice, and steamed vegetables, which made for a fairly bland dish altogether. I do not recommend the tofu rice bowl, at least until it is improved.",0,0,0

Sanagan's has a much wider selection of fresh meats/cuts than Roast (e.g. goat, rabbit, same cuts of pork from different farms); actually label from what farms their products come; and I just find the quality better at Sanagan's at the same or lower price point than Roast.

After a certain time the lobby is no longer open and you have to use the bulletproof glass side. LOL

It was a run down looking room, reeked of cigarette smoke, clean....ISH. We were only there to shower and get a couple hours of sleep each night.

No hair dryer or iron.

5,"Thoroughly enjoyed the food here which what matters to me the most since there were things that were a little off.

I'll get the off things out of the way:
1. A lot of people had reviewed and tipped in Yelp that they gave free seafood pancake as appetizer. They didn't give us any :(
2. We ordered the Jap Chae, which in the printed menu said had vegetables, but there was a handwritten portion that says it had beef. But ours didn't come with beef.

We ordered:
1. Dolsot Bibimbap $9.99
- This was very good. I always enjoy Dolsot Bibimbap and is one of the mostly-veggie dishes I can eat. Nice portion and very reasonable price. The hot sauce that comes with it for you to add as you wish isn't that hot though...

2. Kampungki (Fried Chicken with Sweet and Spicy Sauce) - $15.99
- I really loved how they did the chicken. Big crunchy chunks (like chicken pakora size if you are familiar with this) that are so juicy, tender and flavourful. Portions are big. My issue is with the sauce: it is a bit sweet and though it's supposed to be spicy too there was no hint of spicy whatsoever. 

3. Jap Chae - $14.99
- Really loved the noodles as it has the texture and chewiness that I look for in Jap Chae. The price is a little steep considering the portion isn't that big and there was no meat! So value-wise I don't see myself ordering this again since for $14.99 you can get seafood pancake or, for an extra $1, you get a big portion of Kampungki.",0,3,0

Beef carpacio and tuna tartare  - Save your money.  When I put raw food in my mouth, I expect fresh flavors and ... god ... why is this so chewy??

Pan seared scallops - Scallops were cooked almost to perfection.

Beet Salad - Superb.

Hmmm... interesting pattern of how food got better as it got simpler.

This place is so confused.  It doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Why are you a restaurant, and a bar/lounge, and a movie theater, and on certain nights, a club also?

The first two courses on the summerlicious menu were quite good. Tasty, well-prepared, and went down easily. The dessert was unfortunately really disappointing. On the menu it was listed as ""New York Style Cheesecake"" which it certainly was not - it was more like a no-bake cheese cake with a rather unusual creamy flavour; nothing like the dense, wonderful New York cheesecake I was excited to eat. 

The band was decent - spent the evening playing their versions of covers and we have a good time on the dance floor for a couple songs. We did find ourselves waiting for quite a while to dance, hoping for a song that really got our feet moving, but it never came. So we got up and danced after a couple of drinks and made the most of the evening anyway.

We came in and sat in the section closest to Jones. Nobody approached us for over 5 minutes so we moved sections. I ordered the Chopped Cobb Salad. If you are a Cobb fan or chopped salad fan stay away from this.

The greens they used were like those wild green salads you buy in the store. You know, the ones that taste like dirt? They were not firm and this was hardly a chopped salad with minimal ingredients.

As I dived my way deeper into the salad I stated getting a funky taste like some of the salad was turning.

Bitter & Twisted is a cool little cocktail spot located in the heart of Phoenix.  The place itself reminds me of a New York uptown swanky bar.  Trendy and welcoming once you walk right in.  We sat at the booth side of the restaurant.  

My partner ordered a Whiskey straight up, while I went with a Whiskey Berry Jubilee.  The cocktail menu reads like a book; literally!  In the back page they have a guide or gauge I guess I should call it; to let you know what drink to order based on how you feel for the night.  In the end, I thought the drink menu is interesting, but definitely too big.  Think Cheesecake Factory menu....

For food, we order The Kraken, charred cuttlefish, with glass noodles, thai basil, and crispy shallots and the Angry Panda Tacos, sichuan chili, jalapenos, charred peanuts, crispy anchovies, scallions, pineapples and mint.  Seems like a lot to say, but the Panda tacos worked well. Spicy, sweet and minty with a crunch from the peanuts, very refreshing bite.  I didn't really care for the Kraken; just didn't take like much plus the cuttlefish was to big and chunky.

0,"After much deliberation I decided on rating Smoke a 3 and not a 4 for a few reasons. 
Let's start out with the not so good aspects of my experience and get it out of the way. This was my second time here, the first being a very short time after they opened. I remembered my first time as having waited almost an hour to get my food so I hadn't gone back in awhile, but decided to give it another shot. 
When I walked in they were pretty busy, and I stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes without anyone coming up, so being alone, decided just to sit at the bar. A hostess approached me as I was sitting down and I asked if it was fine if I sat there to which she somewhat flippantly replied ""yea, I guess so"". A bartender did approach me right away and was very friendly, immediately telling me about the special that day- a chimmi churri chicken taco. After looking at the menu for a couple minutes I decided to get that and a side of broccolini and corn. The bartender took my order and I proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. A half an hour later I finally got my one taco and veggie side. By this time I was ravenous. A few minutes into the wait the hostess came back up and proceeded to seat another single customer at the bar. To my right were two empty bar stools. To my left were 2 bar stools, one being taken up by my bookbag, another being taken up by a different patron's coat. Instead of seating her on one of the empty stools she said ""here, you can seat at either of these stools"" without even acknowledging the coat or bag. Of course, we both removed our item so the woman could sit, but it was just odd to choose those seats when there were empty ones right beside me. Another thing that I felt was slightly ridiculous was the cocktail prices were higher than most of the food. Getting one drink would've almost doubled my bill. Even the wine was $10 a glass. Some of them sounded great, but I'm really not interested in getting a $12 dollar drink to go with my taco I'm eating off of a tin tray. 
As far as the food goes, the taco was delicious. I would hope so, since it was $7.50. (For one taco!) It was the size you would expect a taco to be, nothing out of the ordinary. The side of broccolini and corn was tasty, but very stemmy. 
The bar staff was great, checking in on me twice, making sure I had water and seeing if I needed anything. I did remember from my first visit that it used to be BYOB, and I asked if it still was. I was told you could bring your own bottle of wine (only) and there was a $15 corking fee.  $15?! That's more expensive than a lot of bottles themselves! I've never heard of a corkage fee that high and I've worked at several places that had them. 
The decor was beautiful - industrial and rustic at the same time. The women's bathroom was very clean. Maybe someday I'll go again if I decide I need a fancy taco night, there were plenty of things on the menu that sounded great. But I'll have to save my money and make sure I have nothing going on for the next hour and a half.",0,0,0

Good coffee, great breakfasts, love the salad bar, that potato soup is still creamy and satisfying as I remember. Love the whole grain & blueberry pancakes too.

It's quite traditional yet has a modern hint to it as well. It kind of reminded me of the interior in Kabuto, which shouldn't be surprisingly since they are both owned by the same group. 

My friend got their matcha soft serve while I decided to try their hojicha soft serve and yuzu sparkler. Their matcha soft serve was done quite well: it wasn't too sweet and had a very aromatic matcha flavor. I was actually quite disappointed in their hojicha soft serve. I had hoped that the sweetness levels would be the same with their matcha soft serve but it was not. The hojicha soft serve was extremely sweet compared to the matcha. It still had the aromatic flavor of the roasted green tea but I felt that the sweetness drowned out a good portion of it. 

As for the yuzu sparkler, it was like club soda mixed with a hint of yuzu. It was very refreshing and actually helped out with the overly sweet hojicha soft serve. However, when it is consumed alone, it does very little for me.

The broth was very nice but the chicken had slimy pieces of skin on it which don't look appetizing and don't have a texture I like. The chicken itself was not freshly cooked. The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were ok. Vermicelli dish was also ok. The resto was cold because the door kept letting in really cold air as it was frequently opened. 

I tried this place because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews. 2.5/5",0,0,0
0,"I thought it would be big like the Loblaws but no. One woman I talked to was helpful in choosing wine and I got a couple of her suggestions. Another guy didn't know anything about wine at all. I asked if he could show me the Gewurztraminers they have and he asked if that was a type of wine. He tried to be helpful by looking stuff up on the computer but only pulled up a long list and from there didn't know what to do and did nothing to be helpful. I was frustrated with his incompetence and ended up eventually finding someone else to help, which took a while because hardly anyone was on the floor. The next lady I got help from showed me the ones they had but I was looking for something better than the $15 range and from France.

If you work at an LCBO you should at least know what your stock is and what you have. Even if you don't know what something tastes like and have no opinion, you should know where to find it. If you don't know, get someone who does. I shouldn't have to run around trying to find someone.

I wouldn't go out of my way for this one.

If you drive, both the LCBO and Loblaws validate your parking on some confusing time schedule, i.e. spend a certain amount, get this much time of parking free.",1,0,0

8,"Pretty good option in the Charlotte airport that's in with some other quick service options as well. A coffee station for instance and prepared foods as well. It was a bit early for lunch but I got up early and by my palates clock it was time for lunch.

The sushi bar was not fully open when I came but they have a decent selection of prepared sushi in a cooler in front of the sushi bar. Veggie rolls made their presence known to my eyeballs and my selection was made. Take the container to one of the center stations to pay before the sushi bar opens. There's a sign that will tell you so along the sushi bar. However the wait time at the center station got a star removed.

Picked a spot to sit and enjoyed some pretty decent pre prepared container veggie sushi. It had crisp, not soggy veggies and rice even after putting low sodium soy sauce on it. That's a plus in my book. Add in some wasabi and it's got a great kick. Nice to find plant based sushi that was flavorful even from a package. I'll consider going here again.",0,2,0

But I ordered two entrees with shrimp and they both came with all the tails left on the shrimp.  Who would ever do that?

No one wants to go through a stir fry or a curry dish and manually remove the tails from the shrimp. Literally, no one has ever been served a dish like that and said, ""Yes!  I get go through all of my food and remove the tails.  This is great!""

Can you imagine being served chicken with the feathers still on?  Or beef with the fur still on it?  Kind of gross, right?

3,"I really, really wanted to like this, but I had several very frustrating issues that made my first order my last. I should say that the food was good, meals were always tasty and the seasoning was on point. The packs are a great deal, but you don't have the ability to pick and choose what your meals are. When I ordered, it was on a Saturday morning, well before the deadline of 12pm for delivery to begin on Sunday. Sunday came and no delivery. When I finally got ahold of someone they got the delivery out Monday, BUT getting ahold of someone is a nightmare. You can't call them directly. I tried when they were ""open"" but could never get through. They have a text number, that you only find when you call and listen to the very long message before you can even try to talk to a person. You can send a text, but they will not text back. I emailed first, and then sent the text when I got no response to my email. This prompted a response to my email, but never a text back. I responded once to the email and got a canned response. It is impossible to have real time back and forth communication with anyone but your delivery driver. My delivery guy was awesome and helpful, although he delivered my second delivery to the wrong house. I initially thought my food was stolen until it happened again and then we figured out he went to the wrong house. He was very sweet and came back and figured it out and got me my food, but the company never offered me any sort of compensation for four days worth of food that I never received.

The ambiance was bizarre. The place was enormous, with room for at least 100 people. Yet the restaurant only had about 10-15 people in it! It was a bit awkward and killed the mood. Not sure why the place is so big.

Had the fried catfish for the entree and it was served over a tomato relish with a few potatoes and corn on the cob. It wasn't bad but didn't have the 'wow' factor I was looking for. Also tried the fried chicken which was nice and crispy and red beans and rice which were also delicious.

0,"i thought I'd found the perfect after-work watering hole. It combines my favorite aspects of a neighborhood pub - pool table, juke box, great beers on tap, fairly authentic Brit-pub ambiance, and a pretty good food menu. The waitstaff is nice, and it has a Cheers-like local atmosphere. The TVs with various sporting events is a great touch, too. I live in S. Scottsdale, and would much rather hang out at a place like this than say, TT Roadhouse (too cramped), Pattie's (too frat boy having his first beer-ish), Coach House (too full of it's own divey self), or a few others around here. I was thinking ""4 stars"".

Then I get home and notice they bait-and-switched me on a food item - Bread Pudding (very good, yes), it was $3.95 on the menu, and $4.95 on my bill (I'm really not cheap. it's the principle of the thing - charge what's on the damn menu, or change your menu. It's called ""false advertising"". Should I have made a stink about a buck?  She probably bet I wouldn't notice, which is all the more insulting). 

Also, the beers at happy hour were $4.25. Really? You guys can't do better than that? I know of a dozen places that do $3 pints and even less than that at the old HH. I mean, your place is chill, clean, service is good, but...come on. Oh, it's...Scottsdale. Duh.

We were told the owner comes in the morning and makes all the food so they often run out of things. Which I think is weird. The pretzel was hard, like crouton hard at some points, cheese was nothing special. The chicken schnitzel had a 'garlic sauce' but it also had dill in it (which isn't mentioned on the menu) and that completely ruined it for me. It was NOT good. 
Honestly- we will probably wait a few months and try again, as we get that trying to compare to Haus Murphy is hard, that place is everything. So I'm not totally ruling this out yet, just think maybe they have some things to work out.

Inside, there are stainless steel tables as well as bar stools and dividers with the retro/deco theme.

It's been a long time since I've been in a BK and I see it's not jus burgers and fries anymore.  There are chicken options as well and specialty sandwiches.  One of the things I always loved about BK is the onion rings option instead of just fries.

The food here was actually decent for a fast food joint.  My grilled chipotle chicken sandwich was tasty despite needed a little more chipotle flavor.  They even have special sauce for your onion rings.

The roast beet salad was fairly flavorless. The beets were cooked but no means roasted. The nuts were neither candied or salted. The goat cheese was good and plentiful and really provided the only singular flavor. The salad was lightly dressed in a vinaigrette but it was so sparse it could hardly be tasted.

My main beef and reasoning behind the 3 star rating is that some of the flavors are either unbalanced or forgettable.

These two ends of the spectrum are not a good way to be remembered. A bit of tweaking, though, could completely eliminate this issue.

6,"Corbeaux Bakeshop is located on uptown 17th avenue SW where Melrose Café use to be.  According to my French gf, Corbeaux means crow or raven and it is pronounced KorbŌ.

Amanda and I were due for a catch up and we both wanted to try Corbeaux so we planned for a visit Sunday afternoon.  It was around 3PM when we walked up to Corbeaux and there was a long line.  We just decided to go with the flow of the crowd.  Confused, I asked the couple ahead of us if they knew how the system worked because all I saw was a line passing the display of sandwiches and pastries, I wasn't sure how we got a seat and if we were going to get one.  They were unsure as well.  There was a host up front which didn't seem to be doing anything but standing there, so curious me went to ask her a few questions.  I was told that the kitchen is closed and the seating area is first come first serve until 5PM then the kitchen opens after 5 and they start seating people restaurant style (not sure if this is only during weekends).  I think she mentioned that the window seats are for people just ordering from the bakeshop during 'restaurant' hours.

We first passed the display of sandwiches and croissant-wiches, cinnamon buns, cookies and then next a display of beautiful cakes, tarts, eclairs, and macarons.  While we stood in line, we were offered a fresh cinnamon bun sample which was nice.  ""Have you been helped yet"" says a girl peeking over the display - she then takes our order.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon and a carrot cake with a London fog.  Amanda ordered a croissant-wich with cheese and different cuts of meat, she also got the lemon tart and some madeleines and macarons to go.  There was a bit of confusion at checkout because they didn't remember who ordered what but we got it sorted out.  My three items came out to $21.  Lucky for us, by the time we paid there were some tables available so we got to sit down.  There is a station where you can your coffee lids, utensils, plates, napkins and water is even free.  My grilled cheese was good, it was hot and the cheese was stringy.  The bread was nice, it had kind of a croissant texture but it wasn't anything to phone home about.  The carrot cake was good, there was a white chocolate layer on the bottom which was tasty but I found that there wasn't much cake in the carrot cake, it seemed to have more cream than anything.  My drink was the same as if it was from any other coffee shop.  Amanda on the other hand, her croissant-wich wasn't hot and the cheese wasn't melted.  I told her to go up and ask them to reheat it but she didn't want to bother.  She really enjoyed the lemon tart though.

Don't get me wrong, although quite pricey, Corbeaux is one beautiful place but I feel it just needs more time to settle.  With some organization, instruction and customer attention right from when they walk in the door, I think Corbeaux has a lot of potential for success.   Because sure you can have pretty pastries but you need some kind of flow, you don't want to be known as the fancy cafeteria with no flow..

Maybe dining during the restaurant hours is a different story but to me it was confusing right from the gecko.  I'll give you another try Corbeaux.",0,0,0

We came back and they turn all the lights off. Everyone gets a glow in the dark wrist band thats color coded for what time you're done. 

So for 1 hour for 2 people, 1 pair of socks, and a locker was $32. 

Hm skyzone is $13 an hour $0.50 for a locker and socks are free.

Foam pits
Obstacle courses
Plastic ball (you can crawl in and roll around)
Trapeze
Jungle gym 
Tight rope

were put into a catagory (cheap) and therefore would probably leave
a minimal tip. So we got minimal effort on our waitress ' part.

1,"Nikko is fun for a club like ambience if you're party mood.  I've been to Nikko several times due to friend's celebrations, etc.  The food is pretty mediocre and bland for certain dishes.  My biggest complaint during my last randevú would have to be the THICK sashimi slices.  Mind you, I have a LOVE for sashimi but it has to be cut in edible portions for you to devour and enjoy, piece by piece.  The thick slices made the meal less appetizing and I had to cut all of the sashimi down to pieces.  The sashimi gave me an upset stomach, it's either that or the multiple incorrect drink orders that were place in front of me (Parton instead of Tito's).  The pros for this place include the friendly owner and the manager Anthony.  All in all, I know I have to revisit this establishment again in the future and want to provide this constructive feedback so Nikko can fix the cuts of the sashimi.",0,1,0

1,"I liked this place a lot more 10 years ago. 

As it's gotten popular it's gotten kinda not as good BUT the stuff you find there is much much much more diverse. 

Example: I used to go there in high school with one friend every other week and we would split the 3 t-shirts for $30 and get punk band t-shirts. 
There were so many options that it was almost hard choosing just one or two and waiting for the next trip. 
They used to also do prints onto blank shirts and there was a massive (and awesome) collection of options. 

Now, not so much. 
You can find all sorts of other stuff there including a small record shop, an organic fair-trade weird  clothing place called Fairy's pyjamas, there's a bunch of vintagey clothes and a hair dressing place, but the silk screening they only do in wholesale now (big fat thumbs down) and the options for band shirts and tanks kinda blows. 

It's also a tad creepy going down to the dark basement on your own, which sounds lame perhaps, but...get over your fear and go, but personally I'd prefer it if they had a time-machine that transported you to that same exact location but 5-10 years ago. 
They didn't even have a t-shirt of The Clash whereas 10 years ago there was about 10 different Clash types of shirts.

While there are paninis for sale, they're far from anything special. Cheesecake and tiramisu were nothing to write home about either. However, we did have a raspberry torte which was excellent.

2,"It's hard to quantify how I feel about this hospital.

There are some really talented and lovely people who work tirelessly here to make the patients feel taken care of and in good hands.

I've spent a lot of time here and have had multiple surgeries over the past few months, and I feel like I know it well.

The layout and design of this place is abysmal. Tr parking lot is a joke. The rooms are hot and small, the HVAC is outdated, and nothing makes much sense.

It's also really showing its age, and even the nurses I can tell are frustrated with having to deal with the layout and design. They are set up to fail in many ways.

The food here is actually pretty good, for hospital food. It's hit and miss but if you spend enough time here you learn what and what not to order when the ladies come around with the ipad and ask for your order.

(Highlights: muffins, oatmeal, burgers, turkey dinner, pasta, all stellar. Avoid the fish. Soup is hit and miss.)

There are some really curt and rude staff here. There are also some real angels who have restored my faith in humanity. Shout out to the ultrasound lady, you're amazing and turned my whole visit around with your kindness and advice.

I look forward to the Vaughan Hospital being completed, and I hope they pick and choose the staff from this joint and move them over there, give them the facilities they deserve.

7,"I've debated this review for awhile now, since the decor is great, the idea is excellent and the food was good. However, throughout our entire meal we listened to server complain to a table that was seated by someone we assumed was her friend. 

She complained about how customers ask what they offer in the pastry case, and what kinds of teas they have, and that they always as her to go back and get this sauce or extra thing, etc, etc. She wasn't quiet about it at any point, and given the fact that this place seated maybe eight, you couldn't not hear it. It really turned off the whole experience and made us afraid to ask about anything in the restaurant even though it was our first time there! 

Other than that - be ready to wait for a table, since this place is small and there are a limited number of tables. They have a pastry case up front, but it can be hard to see all the options with people seated at the tables off to that side. 

The other waitress that was there was friendly and helpful, so that was a plus. 

Overall: B-

1,"P.F. Chang's is ... well, P.F. Chang's.  The plaster horse that's in front of every single chain signifies that you've entered the asian fusion place of champions.   The interior is like every other P.F. Chang's and the food also is.... same.

That in itself would probably rank itself in a 4 star category if you're not going down to Chinatown for the real thang.

However, the one star deduction came from the terrible misplacement of their Curb-side service.  First, curb-side usually designates that someone will probably come out to take your order or what not.   Instead, this location decided to place the signage out behind their dumpster area.  And there's no video camera or anything so no one comes out to meet you or bring your food.  You still have to head over to the front entrance and get your food from the bar area.

Second, they blocked off the sidewalk with their outdoor patio gate.  So you'll walk the long way around to get to-go food.  It's not only an afterthought for curb-side service, it's a terrible location and there's not a dedicated area for it.  If you're going to do it, do it right.  I'd probably take pointers from Darden's (Outback/Carrabba's) who's had a pickup window/door for a while and they even re-implemented their areas in older venues.

I would probably suggest that they re-do this with the parking that's facing the entrance to make this a more viable solution.  Picking up to-go food at the bar is so 1990s.",1,0,0

4,"Seems appropriate in the wake of Black Friday and Cyber Monday that I just stumbled onto what initially looked like a great deal, but ended up being a letdown.

Cafe Presse is a little shop in a corner of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It's somewhat near SUSHISAMBA and Table 10, and there are both elevators to the Palazzo self-parking garage and elevators to some hotel rooms at that intersection.

This place offers LavAzza coffee. As a relative neophyte to the ways of these roasted beans, I have no idea of the significance of the name. Because of the pricing here, I still have no idea. However, while I was doing what I thought was window-shopping, I noticed that pastries were advertised at 50% off due to the late hour. I guess that they start discounting them at around 9:00 or 9:30 PM (and stop when they close at 11).

Although they have muffins, croissants, and muffins, the one pastry that really caught my eye was the Maple Bacon Kronut ($4.50 regular, $2.25 discounted). Per the employee, it is supplied by local shop Al's Donuts. As much as I wanted to like this, it definitely doesn't have the salty or smoky parts that I'd want from the flavor profile, and the texture was lacking in both a crispy flakiness and a soft interior. I can't imagine that it would have tasted miles better when fresh, so I'll probably avoid that shop if I get on another donut kick.

I do tend to visit the Palazzo fairly often when my mom plays slots (pretty strong cocktails available via cocktail waitresses, by the way), so perhaps I'll keep this place in the back of my mind for relatively cheap late night pastries. You won't find better prices on the Strip, but you'll probably find higher quality.",5,6,0

It wasn't crowded but I was disappointed at how little they were offering food-wise.  I did try the fish and chips which everyone had recommended.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The fried batter was great, truly, but it was fried batter.  The fish, on the other hand, was dry.  Not like flaky and delicate.  Like bad.  If this is their best dish, I'd strongly suggest skipping the food altogether.  

The drinks were solid.  I tried multiple citrus margaritas--all were impressive.  They have this HUGE citrus press right on the counter of the bar next to a multi-tiered basket stand of citrus fruits.  They seem to do it all.  Lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit, all available fresh and freshly squeezed.  The drinks aren't traditional, but with the fresh squeezed juice are undeniably good.  Come here for this.  My friends also enjoyed the variety of beers.  

The service was friendly, but slow, even given that they were prepared for a crowd that hadn't yet shown.

The only reason I'm not rating this place very high is that the line crowding is horrendous, especially on weekends. It also doesn't help that with the way the store is set up, the psychological effect causes many customers to lineup in the left half of the cashiers, while the right half has relatively less people. I generally don't mind crowding (I'm Asian after all), but if it can be avoided, then that's an issue.

3,"Spicy, flaky beef patties, tender, juicy chicken roti, the fiery, sweet heat of jerk chicken, mmmm my mouth gets happy just thinking about it!


I was craving a chicken roti last summer and found Anancy after a google search.
I drove to their Ndg location that evening, anticipating the goodies I would soon be inhaling:)

I found parking easily and walked in. The restaurant is cute, cozy and comfortable, I was doing take out, so I can't comment in the service.

I ordered 2 beef parties, a chicken roti with rice and peas, jerk pork and a champagne cola to wash it all down with.

I asked for my patties while I waited, they were tasty enough but it seems like most of them are bought from the same place. 

My order soon arrived and I drove home eagerly awaiting my little feast. I normally don't wait till I get home but this type of food does not lend itself to eating while driving so I had to wait!

Ok, on to the food...

The chicken roti is a generous size, tender, curry flavored morsels mingled with the potato and the tender roti skin.  The rice and peas were good as well.

The jerk pork was spicy, smoky and sweet, fork tender and truly delicious. It was served with fried plantains, a little oily but delicious! I knew I would be coming back for the jerked pork alone!

I've been back to Anancy a few Ttimes since then and it sadly wasn't as great as the first time. The previous reviewer mentioned inconsistency, I have to agree.

The jerk pork was hit or miss depending on the day,  the chicken roti was not a melt in your mouth event as it was at first taste either.

They came with a side of rice, puréed beans, and iceberg lettuce salad. 

I paid $8.50 for a side of guacamole, which was good, but seemed quite expensive. 

The food was ok, but honestly enchiladas filled with corn is a bit of a ripoff besides being GMO full and not the best choice. How about onions zucchini red pepper? Or cactus?

Now here's where it gets tricky. This cafe does certain things really well (ex. baked porkchop and fried rice), while other items will make you never want to return (ex. beef in black pepper sauce with rice, which had a really crappy sauce). 

In terms of setting, it is a pretty typical HK style cafe: bustling, busy, loud and run by chinese housewives (si lais) who really don't care for their quality of service.  Though these things may be seen as negative to some, for many who have been to HK, this might actually feel familiar and welcoming.

8,"Part two of trying all the Vegan places in town for the daughter. 

Coming here to Chef Kenny's place was an exciting event. A couple of things off the bat, ""Turn the MUSIC down.""  And where are all the chairs and tables?

I have to review this as a fast food place, and not just a vegan place. 

1. Choices - The choices are similar to any fast food place, burgers, double burgers, burger meal deals, popcorn chicken.  There were sweet potato fries and curly fries as well as milkshakes.  Really interesting was the fish taco, a beef sandwich something like a Bahn Mi and a chicken wrap! Heck, you can even buy frozen patties to bring home... That is great. 

2.  If you are- having a hankering for fast food, a burger, fries and a shake, this is a great place to come and get your fix!

3.  If you are - not only a vegan, but watching what ingredients you are putting into your body, then I would caution you that this is first and foremost a fast food place.  Fried, deep fried, heinz ketchup (vegan, but with corn syrup....) and so all the ingredients are well, as normal as you can get for a vegan.

For me, i think that having fast food and being vegan, this is a great choice.  However, I would say, as a place to go and have a great meal, this would not be my first, second or third choice.  I found the music over bearing, the decor a bit trashy and really not too thoughtful, a lack of chairs and tables, I thought the service was a bit slow, the sweet potatoes way over cooked, and the curly fries were okay.  The chocolate shake was pretty good. The hamburger was very, very cheesy, and overly cheesy.  The fish tacos were pretty darn good.

I just did not feel that this was a place I will continue to eat at. However, when the vegan daughter has a need for greasy, junk food, I am gonna take her here and be proud of it. GK says check it out, just be aware like most fast food places, it is what it is.  This place was to me the equivalent of a McDonalds or Burger King and has a way to go for that In and Out type of quality, taste and ambiance.

Pricing was I think $5.95 for a burger meal, but it didn't include cheese or bacon so you have to pay for each topping you want. I want to try their chicken club melt but I saw a $6.75 price tag (no fries or drink). For those prices I'd rather go to a sit down grill like Mac's.

23,"I'm neutral about this place.  If you were selected to be a part of the justice system albeit temporarily you are expected to be neutral, fair and to follow the law.

That's what was expected of me when I came here to 361 University when I was mailed a summons to appear for jury pool selection.  This building is located behind Osgood Hall at Queen and University and behind this building is Toronto's City Hall.  It is one of the courthouses for the Superior Court of Justice.  There is another office for the Superior Court of Justice located just up the street a bit at 393 University.  This is the more attractive and artsy looking building, not just a box.

The main public entrance faces University Avenue and requires individuals to pass through metal detectors and have their belongings scanned through a machine much like the way airport security is set up.  

So from what I gathered in my short time there, this courthouse gathers prospective jurors on  Monday to appear at 8:30 am to be potential jurors.  The room on the ground floor which is the jury pool room seats hundreds of people, seemingly somewhere between 3 to 4 hundred.

Upon checking in the first time my summons was inspected by an officer to determine which of the 4 groups I'd be assigned to.  Each group had a color which were green, purple, red and blue.  Each group looked to be relatively the same in size with their own section for seating as well as tables at the front of each seating group.  The tables were reserved for individuals who needed to explain why they wouldn't be able to participate and be given the opportunity to explain why.  Basically if your'e there on a Monday, you want to be able to get to explain why asap so you can be excused, if you are in fact excused.

For the remainder of those that do not have a reason they cannot participate it's now a big waiting game.  Phil, who is an employee of the courts was there to explain in detail during first day orientation and give answers to common questions like how many days are you expected to be here, will you be paid, how is attendance taken etc.  Phil was a good speaker although his microphone needs to be either fixed or replaced.  He seemed to cut out a lot during the announcements he was making.  

The waiting area seems rather cramped.  I'm over 6 feet tall and I found it at times difficult to sit in the rows of regular seating because the chairs weren't spaced apart in such a way that you could get through easily enough to open chairs beyond where people were sitting in the rows.  I was in the blue section which is the most eastern part of the room.  This IMO was the best area because it's close to the lockers, cafe door (it's a cafe that accessible from the jury room) as well as closer to the rest rooms.  The blue section also had about 5 cubicles some of which has power outlets so naturally people with notebooks gravitated there for some personal space.  The tables at the front on the first day were reserved but after that they were no longer needed for individuals that need to explain their inability to participate so the tables became free game.  

The tables was were I spent my second day.  I ended up playing euchre with 3 other individuals for almost 3 hours before we were eventually dismissed for the rest of the week.

Phil explained that there were 8 potential cases that would need jurors but for reasons he didn't need to get into none of the cases required any of the jurors so essentially we were not only dismissed for the day but for the entire week we didn't need to return either.  

A couple takeaways for anybody that will have to go through this experience here:

- You will be needed for potentially up to 5 business days even if you are not selected to be in a jury assigned to a trial

- The first day you will need to appear for 8:30 am.  The following days (if necessary) require you to be there for 9:30 am.

- Lunch is for an hour and you are dismissed at 1:00 pm, expected back at 2:00 pm.  You must also check in for the afternoon session the same as when you arrive in the morning for attendance.

- Food and drink are allowed in the main jury room however not in the courtrooms.  

- Wifi is provided however it doesn't seem very reliable.

0,"Editing to update review: we gave this location another try tonight, and if not for the manager, I would've given one star.  We had four people in our party. Our server put my order in wrong and didn't discover it until they had already brought everyone's food out. They said they were making my lemon thyme chicken, but by the time they brought it out, everyone else was finished eating their dinners.  

I decided to eat while the 5 yr old had dessert. The dish was so salty it was inedible. It was so good the first time I got it, so I have no idea what happened!  I told them just to take it off the bill since everyone was done. The manager came over then and apologized profusely and said he'd have them make me something else at no cost. They made me Parmesan crusted chicken to go in addition to removing the lemon thyme chicken from the bill.  

So, in the meantime, someone else at the table ordered dessert.  The pizookie trio. The server didn't write the 3 selections down, and we all took bets on getting the wrong thing.   You guessed it.  The wrong cookies came out.  The manager then comped the desert and the 5 yr old's dessert.  I felt badly for the manager.  All in all they ended up giving me all my food for free.  

The service definitely needs work here, but I give major props to management for stepping up and making things right. I'll go back for that reason. Way to go BJ'S, for policies that show your customers matter.  :)",0,0,0
0,"Great location and I enjoyed the tram to Aria and Bellagio. The line at check-in was LONG but went by fairly quickly (about 20 minutes) and the front desk staff that I dealt with were all friendly and eager to answer questions and provide information. Great room rate ($40!), but the resort fees blow (all of the Vegas hotels charge them). The casino is pretty smokey, but I was pleasantly surprised that my non-smoking room was not at all. Most of Vegas wreaks of smoke so it was nice to be able to retreat to a place with some clean air. Score one for the Monte Carlo! Our room was clean and the bed and pillows comfortable. That said, the rooms could probably use some updating. The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling and the furniture in our room was pretty scuffed up. The carpet in the hallway on our floor (the 30th) was rippling, so I hope no one trips on it. Bottom line... A moderate hotel for a decent price. Nothing mind blowing but the Vegas strip is only a few steps away.",0,0,0

A drive-thru? So convenient when you're on the go. The interior? Super cool. I mean, they have a naked Donald Trump bobblehead under glass. Yaaaaas. The food menu is intriguing which makes me want to come back. The impossible burger sounds bananas. I mean, a vegetarian burger that bleeds? I must experience this.

The service was pretty subpar. No smile. I can't settle for no smile. I ordered an almond milk latte to enjoy in the space. When it was brought out the latte art was disappointing. Maybe they aren't known for that, but with so many cafes throughout town that do, I was expecting it. The espresso blend was a bit bitter and overall. It was also really pricey. With tip, I paid over $6 for my latte.

Price: $$$
Service: Good 

I guess Canyon Creek would be considered an upscale restaurant compare to other chains of fancy restaurant (ex like Joeys). Personally, I think Joeys better. 

The location I went to is rather quiet compared to the one at Square One. I went during lunch time, and it was not busy at all. I feel like it's a very generic ""upper scale"" restaurant from the layout to the food. Canyon creek however is known for their steak- so they say. Whoever they are, it is true. I love my steak to be rare and usually when restaurants say they make rare well, my steak comes out medium rare. To my surprised Canyon creek stayed true and my steak came out rare! It had a beautiful red centre and soft- it was cooked well. 

Even though the food is generic, their lobster guacamole is something folks should try. They did a good job balancing out the taste of seafood and the guacamole. 

Verdict: Meh",1,0,0

Looking at the awesome reviews, I decided to try this place for lunch as my pit stop heading from Waterloo to Markham.

Arriving at around 1:30pm, it was certainly busy, however I was seated in about 5 minutes. The menu book was large with a lot of different variety, which is what I like in Vietnamese restaurants. However, they didn't have iced lemon tea. :(

I ended up having #110. Unfortunately, I realized when I received my food that I made a mistake...I wanted to get a beef stew rice noodle soup, but ended up with egg noodle soup. Oh well, my fault. The egg noodles were decent, though a little hard for what I like (but I won't judge this restaurant on their egg noodles since it was my mistake in the first place). The beef brisket was good, although a few pieces were slightly tough. The tomato soup broth was very tasty, although slightly oily, but that's normal for Pho restaurants. Finally, the carrots didn't have the melting feel that I'm generally accustomed to.

Service was initially very good. I was immediately served tea, given the menu book, and an order sheet. Even after I ordered my meal another employee came up to me and asked if I ordered, in which I answered yes. However, the standard deteriorated when I asked for a glass of water but was not given one, I had to wave down two waiters in order to get my bill, and I never got a thank you from any employees in the end. What would've been a +.5 in the start was lost in the end.

I also noticed my meal wasn't charged tax. $8.50 flat.",0,0,0
1,"Nothing screams ""authentic"" quite like a pizza place with an Irish name, right? 

Well, inauthentic though it may be, PMs is a nice concept and I enjoy the pizzas now and then. The idea of ""take and bake"" is a fun one and does allow for the cost to stay low while the quality high.  I enjoy that everything is prepared in front of you. My criticism about PMs pizzas are that they tend to be really greasy and sometimes the crusts aren't as even in thickness as they could be - leading to weird cooking times (hence 3 stars and not 4). I'm not sure what sort of cheese combo causes the particular greasiness, but it's nothing a little paper napkin doesn't solve. If you like a thin-ish crust and lots of options with a bit of a change from the standard chain pizza fare, Papa Murphys is the place to try. Yum.",1,0,0

3,"Try before you buy!
I have been going to this studio regularly for over 4 years.
The benefits of this studio are 
1.   They offer many classes throughout the morning, day, and evening, so you can always find a class that works for your schedule.
2.  The classes are challenging to all levels with a  power/flow style.  Most of the teachers use music as well.
3.  The atmosphere including the teachers, yogis,  etc. is relaxed and friendly.  
Some of the watch outs:
1.  This studio has recently had an owner change and major class schedule change.  2.  There is not a lot of consistency with the teachers as they are constantly coming and going, so if you have a favorite teacher, you need to always check the schedule.  
3.  Additionally the studio has converted the majority of the classes to hot.  At times is can be overwhelmingly HOT.    This is another area where you can expect inconsistency.  
4.  They do not offer much for true beginners or restorative classes. 
5.  Some of the classes can get CRAZY crowded and the studio is rather small so it can be a cluster both in the parking lot and in the studio with the class-changes.

As far as price, they are in line with most of the other studios around.  If you have flexibility, you can save.  But this is another area that continues to change as well.",0,0,0

The oysters that were served by a girl in a cart were not properly shucked, not released from the bottom shell and they were dry with none of the oyster liquor left in the shell.  The sushi selections were ok but there wasn't much of a variety of sashimi. Most of the deserts I tried were of poor quality as well.

This location was the first stop on my tour of beautiful Scottsdale/ Phoenix metro area, followed soon after by a visit to the Phoenix museum of fine art, and then a short excursion into the dessert to observe natural wildlife, including the scorpion and Sonoran cactus, and bury the body. As I sweated through the ostentatiously red rayon of my finest Hawaiian shirt, I had to remind myself that I shouldn't be sweating as after all it was a dry heat. The phrase ""dry heat"" seems to be the favorite of those who need to justify the fact that they live in literal hell to unforttourists. Unfortunately, the dryness of the heat was matched by the dryness of the Burger that I got from this restaurant. In n out is famous for its secret menu, but the secret I want to know is how this chain has brainwashed half of America into thinking that it isn't literally just mcdonalds. While the retro air conditioned interior was a nice break from the oppressive, like the era being glorified, heat outside, it can't make up for the average food, and broken promise of the American dream that has been sold to me by Hollywood, or should I say hollow wood because it sells an idea that is just as empty as the character of the people who live in this city.",2,1,0

1,"First, this place is tiny and being new and we're still in the middle of a colder weather, be prepare to wait during popular dinner time. My friend and I went here for dinner around 6:30 on a Friday. We got lucky and only had to wait for 5 minutes. There's no waiting area though as space is really tight and fully utilized, so we had to awkwardly stand by the entrance door while waiting. Located in the same plaza as thai noodle house and infused tea. Plenty of parking.

We tried their spicy wontons for appetizers and they're really good. The wonton skin was soft, while the filling was firm, giving you a nice texture. I could taste the shrimp and pork in the fillings too, so they didn't have much fillers. The chili sauce had a good flavor and went well with the wontons. It's quite pricey though. $6.50 for only 6 wontons. 

For noodle soup, I had their Szechuan beef brisket noodle ($8.95). I chose to have their regular hand-pulled noodle. The noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. However, the broth was not spicy at all. I was expecting that numbing spiciness that comes from Szechuan dishes, but nope, tasted just like a regular beef broth with some chili oil. The brisket was tender for the most part and they gave a lot of it too. I do like that their broth is not too salty.

I ordered a sparking sangria on drink special. It was very tasty, but at $12 it was less of a special and more of cocktail-on-the-strip prices.

Do not come here if you do not like rules.   You can only jump in your area.  If you've read other reviews adults can't jump with kids so they're separated.

We enjoyed the four rooms with different experiences.  There is the main area for regular jumping.  There's a dodge ball area which alternates between children's time and adult time.

2 stars for all the other dishes

Came here with a big group on a Saturday night. We had reservations for dinner at 6PM. The parking lot was already full despite the early dinner time, so I parked at the plaza across instead and just walked over.

We ordered one of the set menus and added on some extra dishes. Before they prepared the food they brought out the lobsters in a bucket so that we could take pictures with it and what not. As you've probably seen on Instagram or here on Yelp, the main attraction of this restaurant is the Lobster Mountain in HK Style dish. We ordered around 20lbs worth and when it arrived everyone just whipped out their phones to take pictures of it. Taste wise I really enjoyed this style. The lobster is deep fried and then stir fried with lots of garlic. The mountain of lobster is then covered with fried anchovies and fries. Usually lobster is pretty messy to eat but they did a great job cracking the shells and they provide you with disposable gloves which makes it so much easier and cleaner. The Steamed Crab with garlic was also good but definitely got overshadowed by the lobster.

Some of the other dishes that came with the set menu were: snow pea shoots with goji berries, lobster roe fried rice, oyster with salted yolk, steamed double bass. These honestly just weren't that great. For the price we paid, we expected a lot better from these dishes.

Anyway... making our orders vegan we got a bowl and a burrito... and added avo. I got mine On top of my bowl and my someone got hers ""on the side"" as she didn't want it inside her burrito. Now, this very easy request to leave one ingredient off the veggie burrito on the side... this jacked the price up to 2.75 or something completely out of line. My added portion of avo however was only like 1.35 or something... still overpriced. We were in a rush and scarfed down the food, it was good. Like a better quality chipotle if you will. I digress... I just spent how much on some mashed avo!? So apparently because you've inconvenienced them to put the avo on the side it's triple the price. Or no no wait... it's cause the styrofoam foam waste product you put the avo in cost that much? You seriously could have slapped that spoon of avo on the side of the plate NEXT to the burrito and called it good. Nope. None of the reasons. It's a, ""just cause"" scenario and that will be the answer, and it will be given with a smile. I don't know if I would go again simply cause it's rice and beans and Panchos is across the street. So in short... food isn't that special, I could make it.. and therefore I'm not impressed.  But it's worth a try and it might just be the best thing at that moment.

What I couldn't understand was why they devoted 3/4 of the interior space to this monstrous kitchen, leave slice of space down the side for a few measly tables.  That or sit at the long bar down that same side.  I had my pleasant unexceptional meal and left wondering if there was any reason for me to come back.",0,1,0
0,"I LOVE the pizza here, so let's start out by saying, the 3/5 has nothing to do with the food, and EVERYTHING to do with the service/culture/attitude. 

Prior to the competition opening on College Street, I guess it didn't matter much, because they were the only show in town with phenomenal vegan pizza, but now, it's such a hassle that I question whether or not it's worth the pain and frustration. 

Ordering:
During peak times, expect to spend about 20 minutes calling and trying to get through. 
If you're ordering multiple pies, be prepared that they may not be able to accommodate your order at all. 
The only way to order online is via UberEats (why they haven't adopted something like Ritual baffles me... not enough capacity in the kitchen, maybe?), which means you have to factor the cost of delivery into the price of your order.
The eStore is not working. 

Parking:
Extremely limited street parking. You may have to wait, or park illegally. If you park illegally, bring a back up driver, because you'll be in there a while. 

Picking up:
There is often a line up. Since you cannot pay over the phone or online, you will have to wait in a long line to pick up your order. No apologies will be offered. 

I've kept quiet about this for a long time, but now that everybody and their brother has vegan options, I hope this business steps up to the plate, gets it together, and is able to continue to thrive. But, when I pay $31 for a large pizza, I need to receive $31 worth of value, and quite frankly, I'm not, and I haven't in a long time.",0,0,0

* The neighborhood was a little sketchy. We didn't have any problems, but it wasn't a great area.

I got there early for the dinner hour and got a seated at a small table right away, being alone they tried to talk me into sitting at the bar without being pushy.  By the time I left folks were waiting to be seated.  

I opted for the sustainable beef (medium) on Ciabatta with blue cheese and a spicy aoili ($12.35) .  It came with a tiny slice of onion, a tiny slice of tomato, a pickle spear and a slice of lettuce (see picture).  I also got a side salad ($2.50).  It was a good, but not great, burger.  For me it didn't live up to the hype.  I have had burgers that tasted just as good from Red Robin for less.

I seemed to arrive as shifts were changing, my original waitress was by quite often but towards the end I had a waitress that was working another part of the restaurant and I only saw her when she came to check on me.

The Takoyaki had 5 pieces.  The size of the octopus was small so it wasn't worth it.

Overall, the garden is not as extensive as i had envisioned. i imagine this was not the ideal time to go at the end of the summer to see everything in bloom, but we decided it would be a nice place to picnic and it was. We used a BOGO coupon from the Entertainment book making admission a reasonable $12 for the two of us. 

We were kind of excited to check out the Something's A-Flutter exhibit in the Orchid Conservatory. There were some interesting butterfly informative exhibits, but i think i only saw like 4 actual butterflies throughout the whole conservatory?? WTF?  i imagined nothing but butterflies swarming me, having to fight them off from carrying me away. Regardless, the conservatory was the highlight of the trip at this time of year, with a nice water wall of flowers and such. 

The Botanical Garden is a good place to take a visiting (perhaps older)  relative or any botanical enthusiast in your life or if you've got an Entertainment book, it might be worth checking out one time (although i imagine i have to check it out again in the spring to be fair).",4,2,0

Granted, it's Sunday night of a holiday weekend at 8pm, but we've been waiting over almost an hour for our food. Seems that to-go orders are getting priority while we still just sit here. Watching to-go people come and go while we wait is VERY disappointing. Maybe they should treat their sit-down customers with a little more priority. I'm feeling we can't keep coming back here. So disappointing. 

Edited to add on 8/8/18: we wanted to try this place again as the sushi is so good, but disappointed to see that they still care far more for the to go orders than the diners. We've been waiting over a half an hour. 5 of the tables still have no food but the to go order folks keep coming and going with HUGE containers. So disappointing.",0,1,0

Service here was great. He was friendly and actually refilled our waters even when the bottle was in front of us. When we were ready to order, majority of our party got the pastas and two had the pizzas. The pizza did come in a reasonable size and smelled delicious. On the other hand, I felt like my spinach pappardelle dish was considerably small for the price I was paying. I guess at least it did tasted yummy and fresh. My fiancee got their ravioli and I thought it tasted average. The sauce was tasty but the filling in the ravioli was a bit disappointing. At the end, I don't think I would purposely make a trip downtown to eat here unless my friends insisted here again. I guess next time I could try the pizzas - which had double the choices than their pastas. If you want a tasty Italian pasta dish though, I suggest you head to Tostos in Vaughan.",0,0,0

The cheese fondue that my friends ordered was lip smacking. The red wine went perfectly with the meal. The dessert was disappointing. While the crème brulèe was tastefully done - crusty texture outside and creamy when you dig in your spoon, I felt the quantity was a huge let down. The cutlery was tiny and the creme brule was only half-filled! That wasn't the case with others on the table. Clearly this was someone's fault in the kitchen and they decided that it's okay for a customer to take the hit. Overall, a fine meal.

5,"Yes, it's old and rundown. It's a standard Hilton, so all the extras cost extra. It's also off the Strip (but on the Monorail), but the Las Vegas Hilton does have some things going for it.

First of all, if you need to go the the convention center, the location is great. It's just one Monorail stop. About five minutes door to door. That's valuable if you've got an early conference, and you were out too late the night before,

And the proximity of the Monorail is hard to beat. Right out front, and you're anywhere on the Strip that you want to be. Get a multiday pass, and you'll save time and money on cabs.

It's old, but clean. And the staff is good.

You get Hilton Honors points, perhaps the best hotel loyalty program out there.

And I love the sports book. I've watched a few games there. They have a large number of friendly chairs, and the crowd is friendlier than many other spots.

8,"For all the glamour and class that this restaurant oh so proudly advertises itself to be, they definitely got their appearances down with the baby blue interior design, ceramic hot pot bowl covers, and silver high tea trays. The atmosphere is all there and even the customer service is great (with employees checking in every so often to ask about the meal). 

Unfortunately though, I can't say the same about the quality or value of their food. After having tried a wide selection of items, my party of 4 collectively agreed that the dishes were all very hit or miss and overall, the food was subpar compared to other hot pot restaurants. Luckily we came for the BOGO promotion but at their regular price on a weekend? $27 + $3-9 soup base plus tax and tips? Noooooo thank you. There's MUCH better food to be had (hot pot or not) at that price! 

Noteworthy, their ""handmade balls"" were all very unimpressive even though they should be the staples of hot pot. My table was very disappointed that the ""store bought"" fish balls were the only tasty ones. Further, while some of the soup bases were delicious (black chicken base and mushroom variety base), the miso base was ridiculously over-salted. 

I guess the one positive that did stick out for me was the chocolate fondue, which was surprisingly very delicious. Although it was a bit too runny, they used a darker cocoa which had a very rich and deep flavour. I wish that part was also all you can eat!! 

In summary, my party of 4 has decided that we won't be coming back. It was a cool experience and this restaurant has definitely created a very intriguing new take on hot pot but at that price point serving mediocre food - we'll pass.",2,3,0
0,"Great start! However, there are some gaps and it's early. Here's my review. 

Food ordered: Thai Iced Tea (2), pineapple with pork and palm sugar, lamb chops with tamarind dip/cabbage, PEI scallop curry and rice

All dishes had a great punch of flavour. For two people with tips, this was $100 or so. Did I leave happy and satisfied? No. If you want to be truly full, you're probably going to spend well over $100. Pineapple dish could've been helped with 2 more pieces. The scallop curry, scallops themselves were clearly well over cooked sitting in the curry. I would expect to see just done scallops for a $30 curry. Great tasting lamb chops. Something you'd expect at a bbq place. What do we do with all the garnishes on the plate? A server explaining this would've been good. 

Service: I didn't get a server within 5 mins of sitting. I had to wave down a guy to find one and never did. Instead I found one by just asking another server who walked past by. The curry dish, which was the last took the longest to arrive. We had our white rice already but it was ice cold by the time curry arrived. Not sure if the curry comes with rice or not. 

Conclusion: Great spot for drinks and some snacks before heading somewhere else. Not so much (at the moment) for dinner.",0,0,0

We tried their beef tips and green chile enchiladas. Both were pretty good and had great flavor profiles. The beef tips were slightly overcooked as well as the rice, but overall it was all good. The service was okay and the food came out pretty quickly as we asked for it to be expedited to make our show on time.

2,"Fran's done changed.
I used to go here a lot in high school. Partly because it was cheap and you could sit for hours and drink coffee and smoke, and partly because I was addicted to their home fries (which are more like tater tots than fries or potatoes).

I just went back again today and was pleasantly surprised to find that although the old diner charm is pretty much identical to my youth, the menu has been significantly upgraded.

It's still a greasy spoon with tater tots for home fries, but what other greasy spoon offers vegetarian breakfast sausage? In fact, there's a lot of vegetarian options added to the menu and formerly banned delicacies like fruit run rampant throughout the menu.",1,2,0
2,"The course was recently acquired by Bruce Golf and is now part of their rewards system.  The facility is a bit tired and run down and it ain't the prettiest course around, but it's definitely the best value in the GTA.

The greens were in horrible shape, but the fairways were okay.  

It's a decently challenging enough of a course with a few very hard holes, but the vast majority is much more forgiving.  Essentially you're playing most of the course around a creek, but the biggest water hazard comes on the first hole.  If you don't hit a long drive off the tee, good luck getting it over the pond guarding the green, if it's against the wind most people will have to lay up and 2 putt for boggie.  If you happen to plop one in the water and three putt, then that'll make for a crappy way to start the day! (And *ahem* I know exactly how that feels)

Food 3/5
We ordered the highly rated oyster slider, fish and chips, gumbo and a bag of the mussels in good catch blend. The oyster sliders was definitely the favourite and most unique item compared to the rest. The fried oyster was proportion sized ""patty"" for the slider which meant you had a piece in every bite. The sliders also included fried onions that added to the sweetness and a tangy sauce that helped cut the grease. Fish and chips were fairly basic, it came with two decent sized pieces of fish that were flaky and not overly fried. Gumbo had a nice smokey flavour when you first taste it but fades and becomes bland. However it does come with generous pieces of ingredients such as shrimp and okra. Finally the bagged seafood was nothing to rave about. It's nothing special compared to its competitors except for the different flavoured sauce. The good catch blend had a nice spicy kick but wasn't as flavourful and garlicky compared Captain's Boil. 

Service 4/5
Our server was nice and friendly. Although it was a busy night she still found the time to check up on us in between our meal. 

All in all it was a good meal. The four items came to $60 pre-tax. It would be a great place to eat before or after a movie but I wouldn't purposely make a trip to eat there. If you do eat at Catch I would recommend eating the boiled seafoods at the competitors and trying the more unique items on the back.",0,0,0

Dundas St. W west of Bay St.

Just a bit north of the City Hall, this restaurant was pretty busy throughout our entire dinner there. You can park your car under the City Hall for $8 all night and take a short walk over, while enjoying downtown attractions.

Decor/Ambience: 3.5/5

Comfy and cozy booths, seating 6 at most together. Could be more decorative. Larger groups would have to sit in separate booths that are all along one side of the restaurant.

Food quality: 3.5/5

Comfort Korean food with the usual appetizers, hot stone bowl meals/bibimbap, pancakesand teriyaki's. Not that many options to choose from.

Next time I might order their seafood pancake as it looks more appetizing than my salmon bibimbap, which came with a nice amount of veggies, but the stone bowl that it was served in had a few cracks at the bottom, which I did not know until I have already eaten my entire meal...

Service: 3.5/5

The waitress came to refill our water every so often and they served us the usual Korean sides.

They were busy, but not too packed that they had to ask us to leave or rush us out, so we stayed back for another half an hour after we have already paid for our meal. 

Value: 4/5

Big complaint: Our room was in the West Wing.  It was built way back when and renovated. They didn't bother to add a new elevator shaft when they connected the new MGM to the West Wing. So you walk for about 15 mintues to get to your room, and then 15 minutes back.  
The ceilings are really low- it's like walking into a fading perspective drawing.  There are mirrors at the end of the hallway- so it looks like you'll be going on forever.  After hiking the length of the West Wing to the elevator, we had to hike back again on our floor to get to our room.
The interior of the room is quite modern- glass and mirrors abound.  Heavy glass doors on both the bathroom stall and the adjacent shower.  (No tub). 
My favorite feature was the lighted and magnified make up mirror. 2nd favorite feature was the shower.

Truth be told I wouldn't have booked a room if it weren't for the convenient location to the Rock 'n' Roll Half Marathon.  We arrived to check in on Saturday evening.  We were ""upgraded"" to a room on the Hilton Honor's level, but probably because the place is completely booked up.  The room on the HH level comes with the same amenities as the regular level.  However, we received the following unexpected bonuses: 2 breakfast vouchers, a $5 off coupon to the bar/restaurant, and 2 drinks with appetizers vouchers.  

The front desk didn't seem too welcoming, but I'll let that one slide since he gave us freebies.  The room is pretty good in size with space for a couch and desk.  I thought it was clean, and I felt comfortable resting my body there for a night.  The only thing that irked me about the room is the lack of ventilation in the bathroom.  The smoke detector came on 10 minutes after I had taken a shower.  We tried calling the front desk for help, but no one answered the phone.  The neighbors came out to see what's going on.  I had to open up the patio door and luckily the alarm went off after five minutes.  No other fiasco encountered after that.

There is not much going on, especially walking distance around the hotel.  But if you have a car, I would highly suggest checking out Cornish Pasty Co.

There were a group of us and I remember getting terrible service!!! We didn't leave a good tip as a result of that and the waitress actually chased us down.  Aren't tips earned? 

I went back to Hodori because my friend said they're under new management, so I thought ok I'll give it another shot.  This time the service was wayyyyyyy better so I stay loyal to Hodori.

The sandwich was good with crispy bread and nicely melted cheese. The soup was nice and tomato-ey with a just a hint of spice. The mashed potatoes were good basic mashed potatoes, but (and maybe it's just me) mashed potatoes do not seem like an appropriate side for a grilled cheese sandwich.  Additionally, the honey mustard looks like gravy and, be warned, it is not tasty on the potatoes (although, that's my fault for not paying attention). One complaint, Layers wanted $1.50 to add pickles to a sandwich.

This was my second visit in two years and I was was unexpectedly disappointed. I ordered beef BBQ ribs, collard greens, mac n cheese and cornbread. Beef ribs are not typically tender so I was not surprised at the lack of tenderness, but they were tasty. I'm not sure what was going on with the collards. They were tough and somewhat bitter. On my previous visit, the collards were 5-star tender, succulent and tasty. Maybe it was a market issue where there was no  access to greens of a better texture. The mac n cheese was a little dry but the taste was spot on. The meal was not terrible, but I was disappointed.

I suppose I would be willing to chance another visit, but none of my party of six are willing to come with me. What a shame.",0,0,0
0,"I have to preface this by saying I love Starbucks! Love their drinks, food, merchandise, etc. we were so happy when this Starbucks opened, as its right by our church/school. The building is very pretty inside and out, and everything is working and available unlike the Starbucks on Eastern, south of this location. This alone gets three stars.

But let me now write about what gets ZERO stars. The customer service. For the first month or so, it was GREAT! Then, it was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Fast forward to last week. I got two vanilla frapachinos for my kids, one with caramel. I get this every time and have never had an issue. I pull up to the window, and I'm waiting, and waiting, and then the barista starts to make my drinks. I'm the only car in the drive-thru, so it's not busy.

As he's making them, I'm watching, and see that he makes them both without caramel. I stated caramel, and I was charged for caramel, but no biggie, it's a mistake! He eventually opens the window and starts to take my card. I say ""I'm sorry, I tried to get your attention to tell you, but one of those should have caramel."" He looks at me, slams my card on the counter, then rolls his eyes at me and sighs! REALLY??? He then slams the window shut, and angrily fixes the issue. Opens the window back up, gives me my drinks, my card, and no straws. He then realizes he didn't give me straws, hands then to me, and closes the window.  No ""thank you"", no ""sorry for the mix up"", nothing. Terrible customer service.

I tried to get his name, but we was wearing a blank name tag. So barista with the grating goatee, thanks for the less than stellar service! If I happen to be ""helped"" by you again, I'll make sure to get your name.",1,0,0
5,"My pub crawl compadres and I stopped at Majerle's after having a brief but terrible experience at Networks. I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? 

We attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?

Anyway, I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game, but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food, cheaper drinks, and friendlier service.",4,4,0

The noise level however was deafening, and we felt rather rushed for someone else to get our table.

The food- I don't know if i had my expectations to high because of the hype over this place but I must admit i was disappointing. I opted for the famous pulled pork and mac sandwich and it was dripping in fat and grease, eek.

3,"Nice looking little place. We were promptly seated, but the service was a bit slow as the evening progressed. The diners who had brought their own beer/wine seemed to receive better service. All three of us ordered ice green tea and were surprised to receive cans instead of brewed. I honestly thought the waitress was surprised at us ordering it.

We ordered a variety of items, including the salmon-covered california roll and the unagi nigiri. The sushi we had was very fresh, and I think the unagi was the most flavorful I've had. The rolls in general were a bit losely made, and the shrimp tempura roll was simply out of proportion: there was no way to eat a single piece without taking multiple bites, so it kind of ruined the concept of a ""roll"".

While nothing was bad per se, there wasn't really anything special that inspired me to want to return, and the prices were really high. I'd have rated it 4/5 if the prices had been more in line with other sushi restaurants.

1,"This was my first appointment with ALS, I was excited about the concept and membership. The receptionist was friendly and greeted me as I entered and gave me updates on when I would be back to receive my services. The decor is clean and modern with pink and white as colors and there are about 13 private studios, each with their own table, neck pillow and under the knee pillow to make your time there more comfortable. I was told that all the technicians that work there are either licensed estheticians or cosmetologist which is always nice to hear. I opted for the ""gorgeous"" lash style (fuller, longer) which took about 2 hours since it was a brand new set and boy, do I love the results. They recommend you come in for refills every 2-3 weeks which should only take about 45 minutes and if you get the membership, it only costs you $45 - which coincidently is covered by the monthly membership fee. If you have the membership and you don't use it for 1 month, that credit rolls over to the next month. What is really nice is that your membership can be put on hold once a year, anywhere from 1-6 months at a time. I've had lashes in the past and got tired of the maintenance and stopped, but now I'm back because I miss this little luxury and the membership hold is perfect for me when I need a break. I have already booked my next appointment for 3 weeks out and will be curious to see how long they last.

So why only 3 Stars? Well they aren't so timely. I had a 3 o'clock appointment then was called the day of at 1:15 informing me not to come in until 3:15 otherwise I'd be waiting awhile since they squeezed someone in between appointments. This was irritating to hear for 2 reasons: (1) I had called the day before to see if I could bump up my appointment, but was told they couldn't unless I wanted to come in at 2:45 to see if the technician finished early; and (2) they didn't call to SEE if I could move my appointment back, but rather advised me to come in later so I didn't end up sitting in the waiting room long - it was already decided by someone else that my appointment time didn't matter. I even filled out the paperwork which required me signing their contract they have regarding cancellations. There is a note on this page that says any customer that is 15 mins late will be considered a ""no show"" and be responsible to pay 50% of the service they requested, but apparently the company doesn't care about their client's time. 

It's a shame this was my first impression, but obviously I believe in second chances as I already made another appointment and will be more than happy to update this review with a (hopefully) higher rating. P.S.  I got called back at 3:40 - 40 mins after my appointment, 25 mins after when I was advised to come in and wait.",0,0,0

8,"So the family and I were in the car trying to figure out where to eat and my wife says Let's try Shelly Pie. So we made our way there. I had heard a lot about this once VFW hall turned Pizza restaurant so we were excited to see what all the hype was about. Upon arriving the parking lot confused me as you have to enter of the street in the rear.

As we walked in I was pleasant surprised as the space is open and very modern compared to the building's exterior.  I must say that this placed reminded me of Gateway Grill and Rivertowne Pour House in Monroeville. It was pretty loud too. They do have several flat screen TVs to catch a game though.  

Once inside we seated ourselves and were greeted by Patty. She was very funny as we told her it was our first time there. A couple minutes later our waitress Sara C came and took our drink orders. 

For our appetizer we went with the fried Zucchini Planks. You get six to an order and they come with either ranch dressing or marinara sauce. They were very, very good.

For our entrees my wife and I both went with ShellZones (Shelly's version of the calzone) For topping my wife got pepperoni, cappicola ham, banana peppers and mushrooms and I got steak, bacon and mushrooms. Our daughter got the 1/2 pound angus burger with American cheese, grilled onions, bacon, lettuce and tomato with a side of fries. Looking at other meals being served while we were waited for ours I must say that their portions are pretty huge for the price.

Our daughters burger arrived first so she dug in. I did try a couple of her fries and I must say they were very good.

A few minutes later our calzones came, but mine was wrong. Mine came filled with steak, mushrooms and banana peppers instead of being filled with what I had ordered. I had our waitress take it back and have a corrected calzone made. Not to mention they gave me my same marinara sauce that came with the first calzone and by then it was ice cold so I had to flag the waitress down to bring me fresh and hot marinara sauce. 

By the time my corrected calzone and hot marinara sauce came my wife and daughter were done and pretty much ready to go so I only ate a couple of small pieces and had the rest wrapped to go. What I did taste was delicious though. 

It wasn't our waitresses fault as she took down the right calzone toppings as it was notated correctly on our check when we paid. She did take the drinks off our bill which was better than nothing....",2,5,0

1,"We ate at Sushi Roku at an off-time around 2 pm, and the restaurant was not very crowded.  Much of the seating in Sushi Roku offers excellent Strip views which is a definite plus.  We were originally going to be sat at a booth/table close to another couple, but asked to be sat at a separate table for a bit more privacy.  The hostess got very huffy and irritated when we made this request, so our dining experience did not begin well.
  
The server was efficient, but not overly-friendly.  We ordered edamame, miso soup, and several sushi rolls (Katana, spicy tuna, California, and toro & jalapeño).  The food was good, but overpriced, and the quality/taste wasn't heads and tails above more economical sushi restaurants.  Of course, you're on the Strip, not to mention paying for a Strip view, so the high price is to be expected.  All in all, if you're looking for a sushi restaurant with a Strip view, Sushi Roku is not a bad bet.

FOOD:

went with my gf, and we ordered
Calamari
Lamb & Rosemary sausage
Pulled pork sandwich

I personally disliked the calamari because it had a very starchy taste to it, also looked very unimpressive.  my GF however enjoyed it.

The Lamb sausage had good flavor, but a bit dry.  The accompanying sides mash potato and vegetables were good.

The Pull-pork sandwich itself was good, however the fries were to salty and the colsaw was tasteless


Service:

Service was ok, however one thing did annoy me.  Our server did not mention to us the daily specials or w/e they are called.  The only reason i knew they even existed was cause i over heard him telling another table about them

Kinh Do is just a couple blocks down the street and guess what?  NO WAIT.  The Pho, Egg Rolls, Bun Rieu are just as good, if not better than Pho Kim Long.  I think they actually give you a bigger bowl too.  And did I mention, NO WAIT?  Drove by Pho Kim Long and there was a massive crowd of people waiting...yeah, glad that wasn't me.

Prices are comparable $7-9 range.  Serving sizes are huge.  However, still just 3 stars because let's face it, pho back in SoCal is just plain better. Maybe it's the water, maybe it's the chefs, I don't know.  Whether in the SGV or Little Saigon, it's just simply better and cheaper.  The Bun Rieu hit the spot here, but the crab mix was not crabby enough. Not enough crab and not stuck together right.  It was kind of just floating all around the lake of red soup.

2,"After trying this car wash several times I can finally express an unbiased opinion. 

It's an OKAY car wash, but I wouldn't discourage anyone to try somewhere else if you really care about how your car looks. 
First of all, when you check in, they always try to sell you the most expensive one regardless of what you really need. Sorry, but I like to think with my own head. The guy at the entrance of the car wash doesn't ask you what kind of fragrance you would like, he just hands it to you. Not a big deal, but why other car washes bother instead? The supposed-to-be wet cloth that they give you to wipe the inside is almost always dry, therefore useless. 
My biggest complaint goes on the drying part. Almost absent. Be aware that your car is going to come out clean, but TOTALLY WET! So you either bring a dry cloth from home, or you keep it as it is, since there are no attendants to wipe the water off your vehicle. Especially on dark colored cars, the water spots are going to show pretty bad since Arizona water is notorious for containing a higher concentration of calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. So I think it's important that the drying vacuums do a good job! I tried once to ask for a dry cloth to the staff but it seemed to me that my request was inopportune. I paid the same $10-15 at other places and I feel well taken care of, so why should I come here? Sometimes one of the vacuums on both sides doesn't work, so again two options, whether you wait until the car next to you is done or you change parking spot. I liked the monthly plan I once did for unlimited car washes but as far as quality, that's a spot they must work on.",0,0,0

I'd rather get more chicken and only one scoop of rice. Also a couple of things that bothered me was that if you get your chicken 'spicy' that's an up charge...I get annoyed when the person you order from doesn't mention it even if it's just a few cents more. It's a matter of consideration, especially when I mentioned that I had never been there...and the chicken wasn't really spicy, it was actually kinda sweet! Aside from that, I kinda felt like a fly on the wall...perhaps it was because I was alone but that shouldn't be a reason to be ignored. The girl up at the front was courteous but rest of the staff just walked by my table without even acknowledging that I was there. I just think that's rude. 

Overall, I would have given a 3.5 star if I could. The food was fresh and good but I think it's a tad over priced for the protein to carb ratio. Also, I'm not a fan of sneaky up-charging and feeling like you don't exist as a customer. However, if you check-in you get two free gyoza and those were good! This is similar to fast food but not quite...I still tipped like I was at a full service restaurant except without the service or courtesy. I mean, I didn't expect full service, but just a nod of acknowledgement and to let me know that I could leave my plate there when I was done. I had to ask the girl dashing by if I was supposed to take my plate up or not. Either way, the food is healthy so if you're in need of getting a quick, healthy bite it's still a good meal.",2,3,0

This location can get busy during lunch and dinner times, but the line has never been too long. The food and menu options have always been consistent with other Subway locations. The service here has never been awesome, but it isn't bad either. The staff seems indifferent most of the time. The inside of the restaurant has always been clean.

I'm a native of Phoenix and been to many Mexican restaurants in the valley and this restaurant has the best Mexican food by far but the manager, who I think is part of the family who own the place, has always been oddly. very unfriendly. She's older, long black hair, always pulled back. I'm not sure why she seems to always be so unhappy but my advice to her is get out of the business.

I also ordered the ham & cheese sandwich and it was really small, but decent:( The price here for a small sandwich is around $12-15 or even more. The wait is over 20 minutes for your sandwich.

Dishes tried include:
- Roti and curry sauce - great large flaky roti, yummy coconut curry sauce 8/10

- Roti and Beef Brisket -  great roti, great sauce, great beef, I like brisket fatty, but I had numerous large fat chunks without beef, not my preference. But the other beef chunks were very tasty. 6.5/10

- Pad Thai - canadian style, but not too dry or saucy, tons of chicken and unusually large shrimp in the dish - quite good, if not traditional. 8/10

- Lemongrass Chicken Vermicelli - lots of tasty chicken, non-ideal thicker vermicelli (spaghettoni thickness), too much chopped lettuce filler underneath. 7/10

- BBQ Pork Vermicelli - medium-small portion of pork, unfortunate thicker vermicelli (too-soft & spaghettoni thickness), too much chopped lettuce filler hidden underneath. 6/10

- Spring Rolls - good quality, nice crispy shell, a bit small for almost $3 per roll 7/10

- Fried Lemongrass Wings - OK, but 2.5 wings or 5 small pieces @ $2.60 per wing???? 2/10

0,"J'ai eu l'occasion d'être invité dans se restaurant très
particulier qui porte bien son nom. En effet ce restaurant situé au sommet de
la tour Delta est un restaurant panoramique (et qui tourne). Il faut une heure
au restaurant pour faire un tour complet mais honnêtement vous ferez à coup sur
un tour. Le concept de restaurant est sympa et en plus de cela il
s'agit d'un buffet unique pour un prix relativement élevé de 60dollars par
personnes (sans les taxes). Je pense que l'on paye un peu la vue mais pas
uniquement. Le service est vraiment agréable, réactif et digne d'un grand
restaurant (enfin presque). Coté nourriture comme il s'agit d'un buffet il et
difficile de vous dire tout ce qui est disponible mais on y trouve en entré des
salades, du homard, du saumon et d'autres produit divers et variés. La partie
entrée est la seule qui se trouve sur la partie tournante et qui est donc
toujours au même endroit par rapport à
bous. Par contre du fait de la rotation du restaurant vous ne bougerez pas en
même temps que les plats et dessert et des fois c'est déconcertant de faire
tout le tour pour trouver son plat et retrouver sa table. Pour les plats il y a un large choix de plat chaud ou de
pattes faites à la commande avec pleins de recettes différentes. Pour la
qualité rien à redire et tout est maintenu au chaud. Il en est de même pour le
fromage et les dessert puisque le buffet vous laisse une grande liberté de
choix et d'assortiment. C'est bien joli de parler de la nourriture dans un
restaurant mais cela ne fait pas tout. Par exemple la décoration est totalement
horrible avec de la moquette par terre et des  œuvres  d'art à
certains endroit qui laissent perplexe. Perso je trouve que pour un restaurant
de ce style c'est un peu vieillot. Le coté tournant est sympa pour la vu même
si malheureusement la localisation de la tour ne permet pas d'avoir une vie
exceptionnel tout le temps (une grand partie donne un peu sur la périphérie et
pas sur le centre). Le coté tournant est aussi déconcertant lorsque vous allez
au toilettes puisque ces dernier se trouve a l'étage inférieur sur la partie
fixe : autant dire que vous avez de la chance si vous retomber pile sur
votre table. Au final ca reste une expérience qui n'est pas donnée mais
qu'il est intéressant de faire surtout si vous avez une grosse faim vu le
buffet à volonté.",0,0,0
1,"Growing up watching his specials my parents, wife, and I were really excited to see Copperfield.  With that said, we probably would not go back.  The Magic was outstanding - top notch and left our mouths open in awe, but his presentation was a huge disappointment.  He always seemed to have such pizazz that you were mesmerized not only by the illusions but by his personality where you would want to just be around him.  Sadly this was not the case in person.  Copperfield presented as both bored and very full of himself.  One point he disappeared, reappeared and gave high fives to the front row but moved his hand out of reach for our table and others, I assume because we didn't stand (though my dad is handicapped).  After the finale he told everyone to stand for him.  When he spoke his lines they came across as simply reciting what he memorized and he often stared down or off to the side and only smiled once or twice.  On more than one occasion he would select someone from the audience with limited English and tell them to stand.  When they didn't stand immediately he'd say ""stand up g*ddamnit!"" and had some other jokes of sexual nature that wouldn't be appropriate for kids (there were some in the audience - though it is Vegas...).

The planned out set list and tricks were outstanding and the show would have been 5 stars if David seemed like he wanted to be there and cared about his audience rather than coming across as if we should just be appreciative that he was willing to grace us with his presence.",0,0,0

The back not so nice.

Not very large or innovative, the steak a burger like patty, sure it had fries, cheese and coleslaw (my fav part of the sandwich, tasted more sauerkraut like) but overall just not as stellar as hoped.

0,"Messini has been under construction for quite awhile, and I just had to try it when it opened.

I was expecting more of a sit-down restaurant establishment, but most customers are ordering take out. The menu has everything a Greek fast food chain can offer, except they were sold out or out of stock on a lot of the items. 

""Can I get the chicken souvlaki?""

""Sorry, we're out of chicken.""

""Can I get the pork souvlaki?""

""We don't have that today as well..""

So, I ended up ordering the most expensive item on the menu - Lamb Gyro on potatoes - for around $12 a plate. 

The lamb was really good, but maybe too oily for my preference. The potatoes were also very greasy. Portions were huge, 2 people can easily share a plate of lamb gyro and walk out stuffed.

There is a large tree next to it and it's overlooking the golf course. I'm not sure how involved the restaurant was in regards to the decor of the actual wedding so I will just talk about the food. They served three appetizers: empanadas, shrimp ceviche, and a caprese with burrata. The empanadas were honestly the best thing I ate the entire night. They were crispy on the outside and I don't even know exactly what they were filled with but they were delicious. I must of had about 10 of  these things throughout the night. Shrimp ceviche was good as well and the tomatoes with burrata were good but the tomatoes were so big that it was almost hard to eat them. The entree is where it went downhill for me. They served a southwestern style salad with a chipotle ranch dressing type of dressing. I was not a big fan of the side dishes that they had and for the main entree they served a pork tenderloin and a bbq chicken. I thought that the pork was flavorful but I heard from some people that there pork was pretty dry. Chicken was just okay but there was only bbq sauce on top of it and I wanted some more flavor. The appetizers got the night started off right but the entrees and sides made the experience mediocre for the food. There was also a discrepancy about the alcohol package that my sister and brother in law purchased with their meal package. They had told them that beer and wine was included, but at the end of the night the employees were stating that they needed to fork over $650 for the beer and wine. Hopefully they can get this fixed because that would be pretty messed up if they said it was included to find out that it wasn't.",0,0,0

1,"I stopped by Lang Van on accident while on my way to find another Vietnamese place. When I saw we were about to pass it, I made my friend turn around since I've heard such wonderful things about this place from good ole Yelp! I've been wanting to check this place out before but didn't want to go at it alone since I am GPS-less and not too sure about that area of town. 


It was crowded for a Wednesday night-people must have came out of the wood works to come here. The restaurant itself is very clean and service was awesome. They gave us just enough time to scan the menu but didn't leave us hanging for them to come back so we could order. And they really care about hydration at Lang Van and I dig that. 

But sadly, service didn't make or break the whole experience in this scenario ---I just wasn't blown away by this place as I expected to be. The food was good however I ordered a dish with bbq meatballs and ended up getting something else and when my friend tried to order one item, the lady told her that she didn't want that and suggested something else instead.

That's a shortcoming of Yelp, that somehow in their default sort, a 4 year old review is higher than a week old one.  Ignore the oldies.

I've lived in PHX my whole life and driven past this literally hundreds of times.  I heard they had new ownership and were giving it a better go.

Mission accomplished.  We went for breakfast.  I had a fantastic gyros/feta/tomato/onion omelette.  The price and side dishes were great too.  Dad had a sausage and egg skillet and it was about twice the size of anything at Denny's or IHOP. 

Like all real diners, I'm there must be a Greek involved because gyros/feta/tzatziki pop up here and there on the menu.

Some of the old reviews knock the decor,  It's been freshened and they removed the old flooring revealing absolutely beautiful real terrazo floors.

Yes, it's still a bit dumpy (especialy near the enterance and the bathrooms) but hey- it's a REAL 50 year old, highway-side diner.  Go to Ruby's or 5 and Diner if you prefer your realty to be fake.

The service was perfect, friendly, confident, fast and everyone helped - 3 waitresses and a busboy were nearly fighting to keep our coffee full.

Can't wait to go back for the ""hand cut and huge"" pork loin sandwich which besides a side dish, includes  cup of really good looking chicken soup.

I've only been there once, but anyone who knocks this place fails to understand what a true diner is.

The restaurant is located in the new Kingsley development across from the Brixx Wood Fired Pizza, and beside the amphitheater. The design is similar to most other CAH locations; open concept with the bar in the middle of the space. I have been here a couple of times and each time the place was fairly packed, with about a 45 minute wait.

The food was decent, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The wings were good, the pulled pork nachos were good. Unfortunately, the burgers left something to be desired.

On to the beer; the place has roughly 80 taps, 10-15 of which were dedicated to your typical mega-brewery offerings (bud, bud light, miller, blue moon, etc...), the rest were standard offerings from more well known regional/national craft breweries, and some local breweries. All in all it was a very safe, uninspired beer menu. No special releases, big imperial IPA's or imperial stouts, sours, etc... Don't get me wrong, there were a few solid beers in there, but nothing that would make me want to plan a special trip there to get it.

The service was another low point for me. Our waitress was missing in action for most of our visit, brought the wrong beer at least once, and was clueless about the beer menu. At one point I had to go up to the bar to get another beer for myself, and a refill of sweet tea for another member of our group. When I got to the bar, I noticed that there were about 6-7 beers sitting up there presumably waiting on a server to come pick them up, with the ticket floating in the top of the beer... 

All in all, both times I have visited this location have been quite disappointing.

Very cute spot.  It also sells art crafts and super super very super soft alpaca items.  But on to the food as we ordered a lot of interesting items.

Limeade:  just like a lemonade but it's fun and different with the lime 

Chicken empanadas:  flaky and soft.  The filling was good but I thought the chicken was a little dry. 

Sweet potato chips:  these chips were crispy, thin, and light.  It came with some kind of a dipping sauce, cheesy... ricotta like? I'm not sure but I enjoyed it very much for its freshness.

Entrees:  veg and chicken special.  Now I wasn't too crazy for either items.  The chicken was dry, lacking of flavor, and almost kind of rubbery? I would say the veg dish wasn't very interesting as it had almost all the same side dishes as a non-veg meal (salad and rice).  It ended up being a tomato, cheese sauce on top of baked potatoes.  I think everything but the entrees were delicious.

Torta de chocolate:  mmmm yes I liked this very much :) soft, moist, ya know all the good things you enjoy with a piece of cake.  I really liked the raspberry compote drizzle on top.

3,"Came Saturday afternoon for brunch.
Waited 40 mins for a seat at the bar infront of the dirty dish basin.

I got vedas, my first time having eggs Benny so I'm not sure how it is really supposed to taste like since I have nothing to compare with. I found the smoked salmon to be hard, a bit like jerky. My friend said it was very flavourful. I found the sauce on the eggs to have little taste.

The greens were tasty, as were the side potatoes. Some peices were crunchy to the centre - completely fried so no soft potato inside. I got a side of ketchup and house made hot sauce. Hot sauce was wonderful. The server said they used over 10 ingredients in it. Strong but very flavourful. Tasted a bit like shrimp cocktail sauce. If you choose half greens and half potato, there is an extra $1 charge.
Portion size was small compared to most brunch places and to most food places in general. I honestly think it is way overpriced for what you get. Portion wise and the ingredients aren't anything fancy. You could make the entire thing yourself honestly.

Venue is quite nice and I noticed a lot of fancy looking people there. I may go again to treat a friend for a special occasion but not the greatest place for tasty food.",2,1,0
4,"First some background about my Coffee Time Theory.  I used to travel for work and in a new city I never knew when I was in a bad neighbourhood.  Especially in California where a lot of the architecture is the same, I found myself where I should not have been on more than one occasion because I honestly didn't realize I had ventured too far.  Toronto is also a dangerous town for this conundrum, because you can be in super sketchville on one corner and walk 3 blocks and be in front of a yuppy condo with a starbucks in the ground floor.  Anyways, to save myself from being stabbed I developed a scientific process for determining if it was okay for me to be at this intersection or not, and Greg C nicknamed it the Coffee Time theory.

The equation is (in the style of Excel, which I used to gather and analyze the data resulting in this foolproof equation): IF((CT + TGIPD + BoW - WYRG) greaterThan/EqualTo 2,""yes"",""no"")

Let's define the variables in the CT theory:
CT = Coffee Time
TGIPD = TGI Pay Day (or any Money Mart)
BoW = Bars on the Windows (any establishment on the corner where there are bars on the windows. Often a convenience store with hand written signs)
WYRG = Where you are going (rationalization: if where you are going makes up 1 point of the shady corner in question, we deduct one danger point because it is the purpose of your trip.)

So... If you find yourself on a corner and it seems shady, but you read on Yelp! San Jose that the best BBQ ever is in some shack across from a money mart and a gas station at said corner, you need to do a CTT assessment before you get out of your car.  If the result is yes, then it is too sketchy for you to exit the vehicle alone, after dark (you may be okay with a friend or during the day or some combination of that).  If the result is no, then get out of the car and enjoy your BBQ, but be situationally aware.

Sideshow café comes dangerously close to being excluded from my life via the CTT.  Let's plug in the variables: IF((1 + 0 + 1 - 1) &gt;= 2,""yes"",""no"") returns a no in this case.  If there was a Money Mart on the corner, it might be daytime-with-friend only, but because it is ONLY kitty corner to a Coffee Time and a store with bars on the windows, the CT Theory proclaims the corner safe for visits at anytime.

Now, onto the actual review (if you're still reading).

The good - there is a lot of cool, interesting stuff in here.  Specifically: 
- An interesting OM style guitar (the orchestra model is my favorite shape of guitar)
- A chair that allows people who are hard of hearing to enjoy music through their other senses
- An awesomely strange gentleman who wears a lab coat and makes the coffee

The bad:
- The coffee is not my favorite.  It's not bad and he did a nice job making my drink, but it's no Mercury.
- They only had 2%.  Not sure if that was just today or always.
- I got over 10$ in toonies for change. (If there WAS a money mart maybe they would have more change... hmmm)
- It is on an incredibly sketchy corner across from a Coffee Time and a store with bars on the windows.
- There is no parking.

I might go here again but probably not.",9,2,0
4,"A couple of years ago I was in love with this place.  It felt like one of the few unpretentious bars in Old Town, with the old, ratty furniture and chill vibe.  Plus the late-night food hit the spot after a long evening of drinking.  Also, Mickeys used to be THE hands-down number one spot to watch Ohio State football.  I was amazed at the turn-out of Buckeye fans who showed up faithfully on Saturdays decked out in every type of OSU t-shirt, jersey, hat, and flip flop imaginable.  

Now, the love is gone and I just have a so-so feeling about Mickeys.  Football Saturdays have gone downhill.  They changed their formula for the Road Grater Bloody Marys, from amazing to downright awful.  I've noticed that the football crowd has gotten much smaller, and apparently next year they're gonna start charging money to reserve a couch on game days.  Greedy bastards.  They also charge a cover on Fri/Saturday nights, and I don't think it's worth paying to get in.    

I do enjoy their food, which is a step above what most bars have.  Yay, sweet potato fries!!  The turkey sandwich and pizzas are pretty good.  And they now have breakfast on football Saturdays and a Sunday brunch, with stuffed French toast, a really good egg sandwich with turkey and avocados, and some other stuff.  

Basically it's still an okay place, but I think they got too greedy and it was better before they remodeled.  The old furniture was much better than the pleather booths that stick to the back of your thighs.  Oh, and I must mention that inside it smells really gross sometimes, like gallons of beer have been soaking into the carpet for an eternity.  Just so you know.",2,3,0

0,"Three weeks ago I called to ask about a spray tan. I told them I have never had a spray tan and was looking for a trial before my wedding. She said I could get the by one get one for $55 and I said yes and she said she would mark me down for that.

Two weeks ago I went in for my trial and I just paid like normal. The girl who gave my spray tan was amazing. She was so sweet and everyone loved my tan. She made me feel comfortable since I have never tanned before.

The other day I went in again and asked for the other half of my special. They said that I paid $42 for the first tan and I am no longer a new member so I do not get the special. That is fine. I probably misunderstood or the girl on the phone was misunderstood. The reason I didn't give a higher review is that when I was talking to my sister on if I still wanted the tan the girl working said to the other girl, ""she doesn't know if she wants to get the tan because it is too expensive."" It isn't the price. It is because I felt misled and no one wanted to work with me or give me the benefit of the doubt. I was only getting it because it is my wedding day so I want the very best for everything. And I don't care enough to pay $90 with my 2 tans. 

Alas, make sure that you know what special you are getting.

Food was good but it could also be the fact that I was hungry after waiting.  

I do love the fact that they have a variety of items however this could be the reason for delays in service. Simplicity in the menu might be food for thought.

Restaurant decor was nice and clean. I do however think they should get rid of there ordering system which is by tablet since I believe that also caused some delays with the server taking our order and my food. Also when someone orders water please I would hope in the future they ask bottled or from tap since some people have preferences and don't prefer and over charge on there bill.

0,"THIS IS FOR OMAKASE ONLY

I am still a big fan of this place, but the omakase was disappointing. I will only go back here for standard sushi fare

The first appetizer was a great sea urchin shooter, but then it was downhill from there. Next was a trio of appetizers that were kind of disgusting -- fried eggplant, and some sweet root thing, but the third one which was tuna and avocado was delicious.

Then came the sashimi, which is still amazing but I was looking for something more special, not ordinary. The black cod came next on top of deep fried noodles which were crunchy and greasy (ick). The cod was nice however, but it was so sweet and flavourful that I needed a bowl of rice with it.

After the cod came a totally deep fried saba fish which is actually one of my favourites to eat, but not something for an omakase, seeing as I can go to Japantown at Steeles and buy it for $7 to eat it grilled. :\

Last was quite a special dish, a seafood soup with mushrooms and shrimp with fish inside. It was really delicious and flavourful, and what I expected in an omakase.

They finished with huge servings of black sesame ice cream which I enjoyed very much.

Overall, the omakase was okay, and I paid $70 before tax and tip. I wasn't blown away, and if you want to go for omakase, I suggest you try ND Sushi and Grill (I reviewed it). They had a TON of little dishes to try and it was really quite spectacular, especially when the desserts were outstanding as well.

2,"Little Miss BBQ remains the best barbecue in the valley.  Apologies for those who read my reviews as I'm sure I sound like a broken record when I start a barbecue review this way.  But I feel its only fair to start from a baseline.  Barbecue styles in the valley differ and the types of products offered can also vary from joint to joint.  Which is why despite my undying love of Scott & Bekke Holmes' beloved Little Miss, I'm nonetheless excited to try out other joints in the hope I find something great, unique and unexpected.  JL Smokehouse seemed like just such a place, garnering plenty of rave reviews despite being slightly off the radar.  On a Saturday at lunch, I made the drive for some smoked meats.

You'll find JL on the northeast corner of 17th Street and Broadway in the South Mountain neighborhood.  Inside a nondescript strip center, you walk inside a small barbecue joint with seating for (I'm guessing) no more than 30.  The ""JL"" in this business is owner and pitmaster James Lewis, a transplant from Arkansas who opened this place in 2017.  Here you walk right up to the counter, grab a menu to peruse, and then tell the friendly staff what you're craving.

The menu here includes a lot of the types of meats you'd expect at any reputable barbecue joint.  Brisket, ribs, pulled pork, and sausages.  But there's other items you wouldn't necessarily expect, including chicken, pork belly, rib tips, and even bologna.  They also offer barbecue nachos as well as a bevy of side options.  Get your meat in sandwiches, by the pound, or do as I did and choose from one of ""Pitmaster Picks"".

I opted for the Pitmaster Picks menu item labelled the Heavy Hitter.  You get your choice of 5 meats and 3 sides for a set price.  For a little more you can get the Slugger which is 6 meats and 4 sides, but I wasn't feeling that intense.  For my order, I went with my meats as follows:  brisket, pulled pork, chicken, bologna, and smoked sausage.  For my 3 sides, I opted for mac & cheese, collared greens, and barbecue beans.  Total cost for everything as well as a bottled water, including tax, came to $28.

They serve the foods in styrofoam containers whether you eat in or take it to go.  Food came out hot and smelling heavenly.  Let's go through these one by one.  First, the brisket.  I know Little Miss has probably ruined me for most briskets, but this one was particularly disappointing.  I've had great brisket at other barbecue spots in town (most recently Trapp Haus in Downtown), but this brisket was super tough.  The little dash of sauce they added helped out, but I just wasn't feeling it.  The pulled pork?  Much better.  Super moist with a just the right amount of smoky flavor such that the sauce wasn't really needed to bring it to life.  The sausage?  Also delicious.  It didn't quite have the snap of the casing I was hoping for, but the meat inside the casing itself was thoroughly delicious.  The bologna?  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think its my thing.  I hadn't had bologna in forever, but I was super interested to see what it would taste like barbecued.  If you like bologna, you'll probably love this.  If you're indifferent to bologna as I am, you'll probably come away still indifferent.  Lastly the chicken.  And it was excellent.  Great smoke flavored char on the outside, but the meat inside was still moist and juicy and came off the bone with little effort.  As for the sides?  The collared greens and mac & cheese were both spot on.  The mac was super creamy and hearty while the collared greens had just a little of that pork inside to elevate its flavor profile.  The barbecue beans?  Honestly, I've made ones just as good as these.  Which isn't to say they're bad, just that they're nothing special from my experience.

All in all, a mixed bag during my first visit here.  Some hits, some misses, some in between.  I would've tried the peach cobbler dessert, but I was stuffed to the gills and had to take some of the food home for later.  I would definitely try the pulled pork if you're coming here as it certainly didn't disappoint.  The smoked chicken and mac & cheese were also excellent.  The rest?  Well, your results may vary.  If you've had Little Miss like me, then this joint will probably fall into the average category for now.  But hey, try it out for yourself.  Maybe you'll come away with a different opinion.",2,1,0

A unique (huge!), but not great (bland) burger served in an awesome old bus dug into a hillside, with above average fries.

Long
Based on the rave reviews here, I ventured south from my office, looking for the fabled Rocky's Burger Bus. What I found was definitely worth a return, but wasn't the 5-star burger experience I was hoping for. As many of the other reviews note, Rocky's burgers are easily an inch thick with a nicely caramelized surface. The middles however are cooked through with and consist of rather crumbly, fairly bland meat. I find the beef at most of the new ""better burger"" places (think 5guys/Smashburger/Clive) brings more beefy flavor to the table.

The soft bun and minimal accompaniments where nice, but the only OK patty overwhelmed the whole thing. To me, a great burger is all about balance, crisp bacon and lettuce, a soft bun, and a toothsome patty all playing off each other. Rocky's is just out of whack. Biting into the smoky bacon underneath gave a some crunch and a little smokey counterpoint to the overwhelming burger patty. But it wasn't quite enough.

Fries were great. In fact, as opposed to some reviews where the fries are sacrificed for the sake of the burger, I found myself putting the burger down after about 2/3 and finishing off the twice fried, hand-cut fries.

Still it's a great deal. A home-made cheese burger and a huge order of fries with a can of Coke can be had for under $10 bucks, so I'll likely find myself back there some time.",0,0,0
1,Starting to slip a bit.  Salsas are only half full.  Meat wasn't as fresh or generous.  Toppings also not as generous.  Just getting a bit sloppy overall.  One plus is the food came out in about 5 minutes.  I'd rather it take longer and have hot fresh meat that fills the tortilla than wait 5 minutes for food thats been out.  Everyone has off days so I will take it with a grain of salt.  If the next trip is the same quality/quantity then it may be a wrap for me.,0,0,0

The Bad: 
1. We were seated at the smallest table ever to be in a restaurant, I think the Guinness Book sticker was on the side of it. 
2. Then we were handed two large ""book style"" menus, a sushi menu, a drink menu, and a sinner special menu.    Just shuffling all that paper made us a little crazy.  SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!
3. One of the items we order was brought to us on a plate that was so large that it hung over the side of the tiny table. Very dumb because there was no reason other than ""looking cool"" in the kitchen when they made it.
4. A little pricey for what you get.

The Good:
1. The bacon wrapped scallops (only 2 for $8.50) were awesome. The best I've ever had.
2. The waiter was very helpful with drink and food suggestions. (Keep in mind that he seemed to see we were having a tough time flipping through all FOUR menus.)
3. The Red roll was out of this world.

0,"There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in Vegas, so the only reason we decided to try this one is because of their House Special Lobster. Wanted to check out how it compares to the same dish made famous in the Little Saigon region of Westminister, CA.

First of all, the place is LOUD, with big groups of boisterous business types and crying babies. Service is a tad slow too. 

The lobster was good but not equal to the California version. This one has a less buttery flavor, is a bit spicier and with a lot of pepper. We ordered a Thai style seafood soup that could have used more flavor as they seem to skimp on the ginger, galangal and lemongrass.

The mung bean dessert was great. It's not a universal favorite but I'm always happy to eat 2 or 3 bowls of it when others decide to skip it.

Overall, decent place but we will still need to make the 4 hour treck to Little Saigon for the quintessential House Special Lobster.",0,0,0

12,"Any dog park has the potential for unruly dog owners. I'm totally aware of that. Unfortunately, I've seen my fair share of rude and downright stupid dog owners here and it's now kept me from going back.

I used to come here fairly often with my very sweet and lovable labs, but after the last time, I decided it's better to not come at night. I've never had a bad experience during the day for some reason- only at night.

The last time I was here, an aggressive dog was terrorizing every single dog that came through the gate. It nipped at my dog immediately upon entering and followed all the dogs around, including mine, while getting into numerous scuffles with numerous dogs. They just weren't your typical dog scuffles but outright dog fights. At this point, what did the owners do? Nothing. They just yelled at the dog every time it did something. They did not take the dog out of the situation, nor did they know how to correct his behavior. They just constantly yelled his name.

It got to the point where we felt it was no longer safe for our dog to be there, as this dog got into it with our dog at one point. Right as we were about to go to the other side of the park with our dog, the aggressive dog got into yet another fight with a german shepherd right as it was entering the gate. I had to leash my dog immediatly and walk her away from the situation, and other owners had to pull their dogs back, so the situation wouldn't escalate even further. 

Still, these owners did NOT get that perhaps this was a sign it was time to leave. I piped up that perhaps it was time for them to go and they still did not leave until their dog got into a few more fights. It was totally unreal and extremely disrespectful.

What irritates me is not the dogs. I love all dogs, even the aggressive ones. They simply do not have the right direction and let's face it, they're just animals. What irritates me is inconsiderate dog owners that cannot and do not know how to control their animals and that ruin the experience of a dog park for everyone else. 

Unfortunately if I'm to return, it will be during the day when there's less people and less dogs...and more considerate owners.",4,5,0

Came here one night because we simply couldn't get a reservation at Raku, and had to find a close alternative, so decided to give this place a try. We got a couple of small plates to share. The portions were very very small and really wasn't very tasty. The skewers combo came with 3 different skewers, looked and tasted like something I made, and I am a terrible cook. The beef tataki was a good choice and I did like that. The tempura combo was not very good at all and super greasy and lacking the fluffy factor that is to be expected with good tempura.

- Oysters Rockfeller - tasty and seasoned nicely.

0,"Someburros is one of those places that gives me pause. I've had poor food here before, but it seems to be specific items (their chicken), as other items are quite good.

This is definitely a gringo place. Everything starts bland, but you get a very nice hot sauce to put on whatever you like. They make a perfect quesadilla, but they call it a folded cheese crisp. (This is a nitpick, sure, but a cheese crisp should, I don't know, be crispy.)

Every meal comes with chips which are tasty. Their enchiladas can be greasy, but I'm not sure if that is a complaint or a good thing. I enjoy their ground beef and potato tacos, but again they are hella-bland. Keep the hot sauce handy. The beans and rice in the combo platters are solid winners.

The North Scottsdale location uses ceramic plates and honest to god metal cutlery, but this Tempe (Mill) location uses foam plates and plastic cutlery. In my mind, this says a lot for the location. Neither method of serving/eating food impacts the flavor, just the atmosphere. I imagine the Tempe location may save a little money on washing dishes/cutlery as a result.

I got the haddock and chips for myself.  The fish is crispy, light and flakey.  I loved the batter - delicious and very similar with tempura!  (Light, not greasy and happy.)  The chips/fries are pretty decent - thick cut, with just the right ratio of crunchiness and softness inside.  Serving size is also on the small size - maybe more fries/chips for more value.

My only complaint is that it's expensive as hell.   $15 for haddock and chips and an ice cold ginger beer kind of detract from the experience.  (The price tag makes this a ""treat"" for an unemployed recent graduate.)  They also charge extra for the sauces - fortunately, I like ketchup and malt vinegar.  (They give you a fresh lemon slice for each order as well.)

Also, they sometimes blare loud music inside the store.  (The first time I went, I just got a large order of chips and the music was loud enough to bother me.)  I won't complain about music if it didn't sound like I was inside a nightclub and trying to order an alcoholic drink over it.  (Too bad I wasn't wearing a low cut top at the time!)

3) A needs improvement goes to the mushroom bruschetta. This appy has potential, but was indeed missing something that my table felt the need to have a full-blown conversation about it. Umm why not add truffle oil? Fat Cat, you already have truffle oil on the mushrooms in the antipasto so why not on an appetizer where mushrooms is the starring ingredient? Or perhaps slivers of parmesan cheese instead of a skinny grate?

All-in-all, it was aaaiiight. Doubt I'll be back. The groupon got us in here but it's the restaurant's responsibility to get us to return...",0,0,0
0,"**Edited: See note from CDO. I guess they didn't take over Sail Inn! Whew. I feel better. 

I've never been more flip-floppy (totally a word) about a restaurant in my life. I either love a restaurant or hate it and usually it's for a very Seinfeld-esque reason. The name is wrong. The font on the menu is pedestrian. The website is horrible. *none of which apply to CDO, btw. 
 
I'm kind of mad that CDO took over for the Sail Inn so for sentimental reasons alone; I don't like CDO. However, I was blown away by customer service and attentiveness of the servers that were assigned to my group for our work event. We were well taken care of and the tokens to use for drinks were way better than ticket methods. Having ping pong, corn hole and stage nearby make for the most fun atmosphere. 
Food is typical bar food and nothing I MUST HAVE and need to go back for. Restaurant week is coming up and I don't feel like I'm missing anything if I don't visit Culinary Dropout. 

For atmosphere, drinks and food; this is a great spot. I could also see myself coming here on a date or suggest it as a ""first date"" spot.",0,0,0
5,"It's a Del Taco...enough said!

I typically pick up large quantities of tacos whenever I need to stop by a job site so my guys can eat. Plus, it makes me look really nice when I buy lunch for everyone! I'm typically a jerk ;) lol jk

I mostly choose this place because they are cheap!",5,5,0
10,"After my dad stood in line for us for 2.5 hours we finally ate the long awaited, highly publicized, White Castle. Well, it takes just like the freezer version in your local grocery store. We ate 10 and I feel like I won't really ever need another in my entire life. The food is okay, tasted okay, but nothing special.",8,6,0
3,Went about a month into them opening.  Say for about 10 minutes with no one coming to our table to greet us.  Our friends got there before us and had been sitting for at least 5 min already.  Had to go to the hostess stand to ask for a server.  I ordered wings very crispy and they can put no where near crispy.  Also. The sauce was super salty!  The cheese on my husband's nachos was not melted at all.  Just shredded cheese tossed on there.  We told the server when she asked how everything was and just said I'm sorry and walked away.  After dinner we moved to the bar.  This was now about 930-10p on a Saturday.  Half of the restaurant had the chairs on the tables. Not a very warm feeling as you're there.  Feels like you're being pushed out.  We haven't been back again.  It's probably someplace that we will go back to if in the area but won't make it a point to go there.  A lot of work has to be done it seems.,0,0,0
3,"Definitely a love hate relationship as mentioned by other reviewers.

I live inner city and often don't want to bother with using my car or taking transit so car2go is very handy....when I can find one.  Its true there are tons in downtown during the day but never at the end of the day and weekends are a real challenge.  The parking in parkades is hit and miss on finding them in their ""designated spots"" and there is the challenge with the signal.  I've been told that some downtown commuters ""hide"" cars on the wrong floors of parkades so they can ensure they have one when they need it.  Don't know that anyone's really that devious but I have been called naïve before.

Service has never been an issue for me when I have had to contact the car2go reps but that is also a rare occasion.

Some frustrations with the app booting me out just when I want to reserve a car and I do find the password requirements (length, use a capital and a number and a symbol) really cumbersome and actually hard to remember but that's not really their issue its my memory.  

Pricewise I think its more reasonable than a taxi and its cleaner and lets face it often safer than transit.

My only critique is having to travel up to 10 blocks out of downtown to get and rarely finding one in my community.  Other than that I love the cute little cars and I'm glad of the service.",2,1,0
0,"Food was good. My family and I went in for breakfast and everyone ordered a breakfast pita. Everything was reasonably priced. We got the impression that the servers didn't really need or want our business because any comment or question was returned with attitude. Sorry, we didn't realize you were doing us a favor by making us a meal that we paid for. Customer service is important, so we won't be going back.

EDIT: The owner/manager did reach out after my review to remedy the situation. They addressed the poor service saying that some people have been let go for this very reason. Hopefully we will go back and give it another chance. Changed my rating from a 2 to 3 star.",0,0,0
1,"We live in Southern California but we always make sure to stop here for their malasadas. It used to be our go to place for poke but the quality of the fish was so bad the last time we ate here that we won't be getting raw fish here anymore. The service was also pretty bad. The waitstaff spent more time talking and gossiping with each other instead of helping their customers. I cook Hawaiian food too and my kids said my Mochiko chicken is way better...I think ownership changed or they got more laxed because their popular. However, malasadas are still bomb!! Hence the 3 stars.",0,0,0
1,"It was early Sunday afternoon and we were out for an early dinner.  Tony's came up and we decided to stop in.  The place looked like they had had full house, every table was littered with dirty plates.  The staff came and cleaned one for us, and we placed our order.

The food was good, I have certainly had better, but considering it's closer to fast food than gourmet, it wasn't bad.",0,0,0
0,"I ran into this place due to the fact it started raining and I was walking around the area. Service was friendly, the food behind the counter looked hit or miss. I ordered a piece of quiche, got to the counter only to notice the cash only sign, and then they told me I couldn't pay yet because mine was a premium quiche and they didn't know the price of it. Thankfully I ate the quiche and the price ended up being reasonable.",0,0,0

1,"My friend and I stopped in for a quick snack before tackling the AmeriCAN beer fest at the Civic Center yesterday. The decor is really cool, very comfortable but modern and fun. The hostess was great too, however our waiter was determined to leave a bad taste in our mouths. I'm not sure if it was how we dressed (maybe looked like beer fans and not his type of clientele) or the fact that we just wanted the ceviche and waters- but he didn't hide his disdain for us or our small order. He said ""that's it!??""And then grabbed our menus and walked away muttering under his breath. When we ordered chips and salsa a bit later, he advised us that ""well it's not free, it's actually 5 more dollars"" as if our order was so small that we couldn't afford chips. The ceviche and chips were great, but I would hope the staff could try and make guests feel welcome regardless of check amount.",0,0,0
4,"I attended an outing to Dim Sum Restaurant with a handful of fellow Yelpers earlier in the week.  The event was planned as a vegetarian outing, so I appreciate the fact that I wasn't chastised by the group for not ""getting with the program.""

Before we ordered, I asked if Dim Sum might be thought of as being Chinese Tapas, and I was told that is a fair characterization.  That's good, because that's how I was thinking of it.  A wonderful way to try different kinds of dishes and flavors without committing to a whole entree sized portion.

When the server was taking beverage orders I asked for a rum and coke.  I was surprised to find that it was delivered in a tumbler slightly larger than a shot glass!  I've been to a ton of bars all over this country and in several countries, and I have never seen a smaller cocktail anywhere.  Nevertheless, we weren't there for the drinks.

I ordered some pork filled buns, steamed spare ribs and fried dumplings.  I thought I might be able to share with some of my more omnivorous friends, but I had the meaty products all to myself.

The fried dumplings were good... I've had them before and they were pretty much what I expected.  The pork filled buns were very interesting... kind of like fluffy, slightly sweet snowballs with a savory pork and sauce center.  Delightful!  

I probably should have picked up on the ""steamed"" part of the spare ribs description.  I was expecting the normal Chinese spare ribs I've had, but these seemed to be bare rib segments that were steamed without spice or sauce of any kind.  They weren't bad, but visually pretty unappealing.  Someone commented they might be mistaken for pigs feet sitting in the serving bowl like they were.

The restuarant also has a full formal menu with conventional dishes in the $10+ range.  If you don't pick up the Dim Sum menu sheet (checklist) at the front counter, you might completely miss out on the opportunity to go the Dim Sum route.

The food and service were good.  I enjoyed it.  Would I drive across Charlotte to repeat the experience.  Probably not.  There are Chinese restaurants much closer to home that I prefer, even though they don't offer Dim Sum.",0,3,0
1,"God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco. 

Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos. But hey, Barrio is a great deal with a good atmosphere and totally worth it for Taco Tuesday!",0,1,0
1,"I had high hopes for this place, because it looks like the perfect hole in the wall you've yet to discover. Cheesy side murals, dim lighting, hand painted signs, all the makings for a secret delicious spot. 
I ordered the chicken Philly with bell peppers, provolone, and mushroom. It was very hot and cheesy, which was a plus! But almost too hot....I had to pause in between bites or else risk third degree burns. Overall it was kind of tasteless. And dry. The fries were no good, we ate a couple and tossed the rest. That's pretty bad considering I love fries so much that my standards are pretty low. They tasted like fries you would get at the public pool snack stand when you were a kid. 
Overall I would say this is fine if you're hungry and in the area....but definitely would not make a special trip for it. Most likely I will not be back again.",0,0,0
13,"Located just north of the Raising Cane's on Rainbow and Warm Springs, Carl's Jr. is pretty easy to find. Never been a huge Carl's / Hardees fan, but recently have discovered their chicken sandwiches.

(+) Chicken sandwiches are tasty! I have tried the Chicken Club and BBQ Chicken Sandwich in the past week and have enjoyed both. 
(+) They have a 2 for $6 promo where you have a choice to mix or match any 2 of the following: Western Bacon Cheeseburger, Famous Star, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and the                    Carl's Turkey Burger. Not a bad deal! Also the $4 deal with 2 sandwiches, small fries, and a drink all for $4! 
(+) friendly employees, for the most part..

(-) as friendly as the employees are, sometimes service can be slow as molasses! Easily my biggest complaint here...and sometimes it happens when there is no signs of any customers around.
(-) while some of the promos are good, the prices are a tad bit pricey if you want to try something not tied in to a promo. $5.69 for a chicken club from a fast food joint? Damn.


This place is alright. I like the way they do their chicken, so I will be back. If it isn't a part of a promo though, I really don't see myself trying other things on the menu. Just doesn't seem worth the price they charge for most things.

3 stars.

0,I had the BD All american burger. I was a good burger but the bun did not hold up. Not even half way through and the bottom bun was soggy and almost non existent. We went on a friday night but the service was still really slow.   25-30 for a medium rare burger.,0,0,0
