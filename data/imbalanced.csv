0,"A MUST DO WHEN YOU ARE VEGAS!! Vegas isn't all about the strip, this place is awesome. From our driver Jenny who was knowledgeable about the area and a great conversationalist that the 20 minutes seemed like 2. The owner Mike was accommodating to all of our Groupons and large group. Spencer our tour guide and ATV instructor was great with those who wanted to speed and Chris was good with  those who wanted to take it a little slower. Chris made sure we had the whole group at all times and gave us tips for driving. Awesome and it helps to make he trip well rounded!!",0,0,1
1,"The before and after speaks for itself. 

First thing I did walking in, was tell Laura my pup tends to be a brat (stubborn, not aggressive) with strangers and that the previous groomer I brought him too skipped trimming his face all together. She didn't seem worried one bit, took Rocky in the back and off I went to run some errands.

She did an amazing job, was able to trim his face, paws and cut his claws. She said he was great and that the only thing he wasn't keen on was his paws being played with but that he would get the hang of it in no time. I would 100% recommend. Grateful she took the extra time with him and got everything done. Also, Rocky kept going back to her to get petted after the grooming which tells me she was nice and treated him well.",0,0,1

I attended the pre opening event tonight and oh my lord, these sandwiches were heavenly! I got to try their rubicon special and achin 4 bacon sandwiches as well as their nutty bowl.

2,"I come from the north east, home of New York style pizza, so I have had a few slices in my day and let me tell you, this is as good or better than anything I can recall having back home!  

Place is a bit hidden and as the previous reviewer noted; no point of sale system set up just yet but if you like pizza you MUST go here. 

The pizza is spectacular!  I tried a slice walking to my car and had to eat another before even I pulled out. 

I'm trying to save enough to take a picture of to post here...",4,1,1
1,"This could not have gone better.

I was told that Chef Gordon occasionally reads these reviews.  Mr. Ramsey, if you're reading this, please be assured that your staff made our 20th anniversary dinner an absolutely magnificent experience.

The space is thoroughly pleasant, with lots of interesting accoutrements and pleasant lighting.  The tables and chairs were well appointed, and I was even impressed with the quality of the flatware.

Our server (Christ) was an absolute sweetheart and took very good care of us from start to finish.  We also were well attended by Jose who kept us stocked with water throughout our meal.

We began with a splitting of a lobster risotto. Absolutely flawless preparation, and brought out at the perfect temperature. I could've eaten two or three more of these!

My wife went with the filet mignon, and indicated it was expertly prepared. I went with the excellent rack of lamb, and was very impressed with the quality of the seasoning.  However, the jewel of our meal was absolutely the macaroni and cheese.  Who knew that macaroni and cheese could be so incredibly delicious!

We were surprised by the staff when we were given a complementary toffee putting dessert, what a wonderful gesture, and so delicious!

Most meals are quickly forgotten soon after they're consumed, I have no doubt I will remember this meal for the rest of my life.

Thank you Hells Kitchen for such a fantastic experience!",0,1,1

The aisles do seem a little small especially when there are other people, but it's way neat to explore. I like the little stores outside of the main grocery stores... I always check out the Asian mobile store. I'm a big fan of NOKIAs so I ways need to check out what kind of selection their store has. I was not disappointed!

The fees are affordable too and I'm never cringing on how much of a high vet bill I'm going to end up with vs other vets that barely take time to look at my dog. Alyssa at the front desk is also very personable on phone and in person and very prompt in any questions or concerns you have. I am so happy to have found this great vet!,0,0,1

I wanted  to find a country kitchen so I yelped country kitchens near me and this quaint little place came up. I don't normally eat biscuits and gravy, but as you can see from my plate I completely devoured the whole meal.

2,"I have been to Mavis throughout the years from when I was younger in school to now as an adult. It feels like it has gone through many different owners/managers but some of the same staff has been there throughout it all. 

Whatever is going on now is the best its been. I order take out from them and they even offer curbside and easy ordering on their app. The takeout food is always the same portion, hot and fresh, and they provide you cute napkins tied around silverware. I like that they include the to go menu in the bags and the monthly specials. 

The meatloaf is my jam, it is a great cut and fills ya up, but i order the full size because its worth it. The mashed potatoes are smooth with a touch of garlic and the fresh veggies are always amazing. I like it when they do the zucchini and carrots. Best part is they don't charge more for veggies you can get any ""classic side"" with most dishes. Other things I love are the pierogies & hummus platter. 

The salads are also great portions that actually fill you up and they have a lot of delicious unique dressings like cilantro sesame. 

True Irish pub feel with great glass doors, Celtic fireplace, and nice sized private space for parties. We had my mothers rehearsal dinner there and it was a great set up. 

We will continue to be a regular here, more so now that everything has consistently been great for the past few months!!",0,1,1

Try them with the Calypso sauce (which is a mix of BBQ and teriyaki sauce) and order them ""double grilled"".  Their wings are smoked and grilled (not fried) so you get a ton of flavor out of these meaty bad boys!!  We've been here three times but we can't get past ordering a pile of these wings.  The atmosphere is low-key and fun.  I really wanted to try the homemade coconut pie but they were sold out on the last visit...reason to go back!!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )",0,0,1

3,"**Please support PV mall businesses**

Hubby likes the food from here a lot and the service is always friendly.
We always end up getting the same stuff, I would like to make an effort to try different stuff from the menu. I will let you know how that goes.

He gets a gyro wrap (doner I think they call it), and I get a gyro plate with no pita bread.

The portions are very generous and the food is very tasty and fresh.

Remember that PV mall food court is a great place to visit with the family because every one can get whatever they want, they have multiple options like pizza, Chinese food, Mexican food, kebabs, etc.
I used to get the pho next door but sadly they recently closed.

Now for dinner and a movie it is usually Picture Show and Doner Kebab.

Everyone there seems to give the client they're with at that moment their full attention and I didn't see anyone rushing on anyone to get to the next client.

1,"They have a pretty good variety. The selection is better than JoAnn's or Michael's, although it still manages to be pretty basic. They have a million tiny figurines to put on a cake, and other ornaments and things like that. I'd recommend it for getting a small quantity of something at a fair price where Amazon would only sell it by bulk---for example, flavorings or colorings. 

I was a little disappointed in the candy-making selection. It stayed within the ""Wilton"" range of quality and variety. I was hoping to find some premium spouts and containers to use with hard candy, but everything was focused on ""melts"" (yuck!) and similar lower-temp, kiddie-style candy making.",0,1,1
13,"I visited Doce Taqueria on Tues. prior to a Cinco de Mayo themed Yelp event at another nearby restaurant.  I'd been meaning to stop by, but it'd been awhile since I'd stopped for grub on the South Side.  This event, plus the fact that it was Taco Tuesday, gave me sufficient motivation to check it out.

Because I knew there would be snacks at the event, I decided to go with two tacos ($3 each)--one of the daily special (BBQ pork), and one of the pollo (chicken), both on corn tortillas.  Of the two, the chicken was the more subtly flavored, consisting of the namesake meat plus avocado, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese.  The addition of a spritz of juice from an included piece of lime added a jolt of citrusy flavor, upping the ante.  The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a veritable flavor explosion, consisting of cherry peppers, shredded cheese, and cilantro. Though I enjoyed them both, the special was my favorite of the two due to its bold flavors.

Like many eateries in the South Side, the space is pretty small, with seating limited to the bar and a small ledge by the window, and no real tables.  From my visit, it appeared that the majority of orders were of the carry out variety, but a few other people also ate in, in addition to me.  Service was pretty efficient--my order was out in 5 min, which I appreciated given that I arrived a bit later than I'd planned to.

The decor was quite festive, evoking a kitschy SoCal vibe, which seemed particularly appropriate given the day and time of my visit.  The atmosphere reminded me of a similar taco shop on the North Side, but I enjoyed the food more and found the price point more reasonable.  While I'd rate the tacos at Las Palmas and Edgar's slightly higher, if you should find yourself nearby, I'd definitely say Doce is worth a visit! 4.5 stars.",8,16,1

(Outstanding and Exceptional)

After interviewing several different officiants', we came across Mrs. Montana Birds Of Paradise Weddings. We set up an appointment with Montana and when we first met her we immediately fell in love with her. Her thoughts and ideas were beautiful, she was the perfect person to marry us and we felt she was right for us and our personality. She was exactly the type of person we were looking for. From step 1 to step 10 she was on point with everything; no stone left unturned. Montana made the wedding planning process as smooth as can be and we cannot stress enough how amazing she is!!  The experience was stunning from beginning to end. She was very accommodating and went out of her way to make sure our special day turned out to be as perfect as we envisioned it. We had the easiest and most enjoyable wedding planning experience and it was all thanks to Mrs. Montana. The wedding ceremony was absolutely perfect! We had out of town relatives and friends who all agreed it was a beautiful ceremony; outstanding. Montana went above and beyond for us and we appreciate all that she did for us on our special day - Can't thank her enough!!!! Thank you Montana for such an amazing ceremony that you performed for us and the extra touches you added was beyond generous. You were way above 5 stars! No words can express our thoughts and appreciation for you. We really believe God led us to you many months ago. We could not have imagined our wedding day without you. Montana, you performed the most beautiful ceremony. It was personal and intimate and it is something we will never forget for the rest of our lives.

Thank you for the greatest wedding ceremony ever,

3,"Getting a new air conditioner is a dreadful experience. Especially when the old one isn't being manufactured anymore and installing a new one requires a complete reconfiguration of the area housing it. What a big, fat and unbelievably expensive mess it all was!  

Luckily for me, I was referred to Wade Walls from AZ Fire & Ice by my neighbor who went through the exact same situation I was going through.  Wade told me straight-up that it was going to be a big job and was going to cost a LOT of $$$. He was very clear in explaining everything that he needed to do, how much it would all cost and how long it would take to complete it. He did the job entirely by himself, although it took him almost all day to complete it. And through it all, he was always very kind, contentious and professional. 

With so many a/c installers in Phoenix, who might have seen a young, single woman living alone as an easy target, Wade made me feel confident I was getting the best deal I could for such a complicated job. I highly recommend his company for any of your a/c or heating needs.",0,2,1

I've brought anti-vegetarian, anti-healthy meal eaters here and they really liked the food too. If someone is dead set against the idea, order them a Big Wac and a shake. This is my go-to place.

I dropped them a note letting them know how happy I was and then got the most amazingly sweet notes back, and learned that a lot of what I'm looking for (such as ways to shorten the hardware for ceilings not super high and a few other things) are also on their minds and they are working on developing and providing solutions aimed more for aerial arts instead of rock climbing.

Parking is not very close to the museum and it started raining just as we got to our car, thank goodness. The day we came in, they were giving out free cake which was awesome!

Pretty happy resident here from Sep 2016. Moving out because I was presented with a 16% rent increase above what I already considered high for the neighborhood. I found a comparable place 2 bl away with much better amenities for 20% less than what The Julien wanted. In fairness to The Julien, they are full so if they can command a 20% premium over other luxury apartments in Plaza Midwood, more power to them.

Here's my honest assessment of what you'll experience being a resident. 

Pros: 
(5 stars) Nicole Cleary is the consummate professional Community Manager. Shalaida Lopez is equally awesome. They both are responsive to any issues and provided excellent customer service.
(5 stars) Maintenance staff is equally good.
(5 stars) Location is simply sublime. Quiet tree-lined Commonwealth Ave and easy walking distance to groceries, restaurants and night life.
(5 stars) Excellent neighbors. Perhaps Greystar is top-notch in the tenant screening department or the rent is self-selecting itself. Everybody here was friendly, responsible quiet adults. My guess is Median Age 26 / Range 24-55.
(3.5 stars) Dog-friendly. I'd up that ranking if the dog park I was told was here when I signed the lease actually was here instead of ""coming soon"". Nice touches such as community treat jar and water bowls. Responsible dog owners too.
(5 stars) Very nice roof-top area with grills, fire pit and recliners & chaise lounges. I grill year-round and never have had to wait.
(4 stars) Nice bath, faucets and appliances.
(4 stars) Security - Fob security access throughout property including garage. I'd give 5 stars if my town home unit had fob gates to prevent strangers from soliciting / casing your unit.
(3 stars) Sweet discount on YMCA membership, but not much help if not convenient to you. There is no YMCA within walking distance of Plaza Midwood. And you will need a gym membership.

Cons: 
(2 stars) Secure access Garage for tenants - There are not enough secure parking spaces for every tenant. There should be at this rent level. If secured garage is full, you're left to street parking or lot across the street during limited times. Property crime is higher in Plaza Midwood than other areas of Charlotte. Tenant cars have been broken into. Perhaps they should reduce rent and charge additional for guaranteed secured parking.
(2 stars)  The Fitness area will not replace a gym membership. I'd venture the equipment was purchased by somebody that has never visited a gym. It's subpar. There are no leg machines at all. There's just a single, rather sad single use station that really can't be used for much at all. No Spin Bikes.
(2 stars) Bike Parking - Like many communities, the bike area is just lip service - basically unusable area of the parking garage. It is in a secured area though.
(2 stars) Mandatory participation of paid Valet Trash Service.",0,1,1

I am an Usui Reiki Master, and I was pleased we established rapport through that commonality early on in my massage as David is also a Reiki 1 & Reiki 2 trained practitioner. 

David's massage targeted trigger points that needed release, and helped relieve my back pain significantly after just 1 session with him.

The front desk staff at this Massage Envy ALWAYS provides outstanding service without fail. I have been coming here for 5 years, and I was quite surprised when I checked in today on Yelp I found I had never reviewed this location.

This morning, the manager, Ben, took the time to call the Carefree location (he even had the number memorized - WOW) to check to see if I could get in to see David again sooner than the next available appointment at his own clinic. Now THAT is putting the customer first! Thank you Ben.

3,I am familiar with this company and know that they are working very hard to upgrade their online presence and give their customers the most positive experience possible.

Very good flavour profiles to their wraps and very hearty as a meal.    The wraps have good structural integrity, however if you like saucy wraps you will have a messy bottom as the sauce usually always pours through from the chicken.

Our food taste delicious. My cousin who had the bangsilog complained that the bangus was all head and no meat. The fried chicken taste delicious. The binagoongan was good but a bit on the greasy side.

11,"3.5* rounded up, because the staff here is always super nice to us, often when long lines full of the Tuk's most impatient people are having complete meltdowns. The lines can get long, particularly later in the evening, but we never cease to be amazed at the full on fits adults will pitch over waiting in line. 

Anyway, their prices can be high, and they don't carry Boar's Head cold cuts - important for Scott because they offer low and no sodium options, and for me because I'm picky AF - but I do like their produce and it is close. They do have good sales and reward programs can save you $$ on gas. 

I've seen some people bemoaning the lack of self check out option here: Scott uses them often, but they never work for me. Ever. I'm just a girl standing in front of the self check outs elsewhere begging them to work and trying not to weep ;) 

Scott was deeply entrenched in their Monopoly game for a while, and the workers were nice about subbbing out items they never seemed to have. Also, other customers have approached him and offered their game pieces as he zips around on his scooter shopping. So sweet! 

Finally, their flowers are very nice. No, really! Scott buys bouquets for me frequently, and they last a long time. The roses come with a five day guarantee and have lasted almost two weeks at times. When my Mom comes, we buy dozens of flowers, and she can never believe they are ""supermarket flowers!"" The ladies who work in floral make custom arrangements, and there are usually some attractive grab-and-go options in the cooler if DIY isn't your jam. 

In all, it is a close by, has a Starbucks, is a well stocked store with kind employees: we won't let grown ups throwing hissy fits over a line deter us!

The server was pleasant and she goofed off with us... there was one time she took forever to get my beer and she comped it for me, without me even complaining about anything.

Also, they bring the food to your table for dining in which is nice, so you're not awkwardly lingering by the counter. All of the food was hot, fresh, and tasty. Plus, a very clean restroom.

My brother-in-law has been picking up pastries from here for the whole fam for years.  He was our ""designated pastry driver"" so none of us had any idea what this place looked like or where it was.

Yesterday after a walk at Kiwanis my husband and I stopped in.  This place was SLAMMING!  But they are efficient and move you through in a polite but, ""Pick or get out of line"" manner.  If it takes you more than 20 seconds to pick a croissant flavor/filling, you can stand back and let others choose - sorry!

The decor was a bit... odd but I don't eat at breakfast places for the atmosphere.  Breakfast places are busy when they should be - at breakfast time - and I just go there to eat and get out.  If you want to lounge and savor every bite, go to dinner or go get a pre-packaged something from a coffee chain and sit all day.

I LOVED that we got there before what seemed to be the 10:15 rush.  We got the last of each of our croissants and they were DELISH!  I had V8 from the cooler and DH had OJ, so I can't comment on their coffee/espresso drinks.

The pizza is not all that great and the sandwiches are dry and not overly appealing but those wings truly are amazing, Have I mentioned that I like the wings yet?  Because I really do.

You could actually taste the sugar crystals in the batter, perfectly cooked and perfectly sweet. It is lucky that we live an hour away or I would eat them entirely too often!
Tartine is an adorable little cafe, cash only, where the resident dog greets you at the door. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is simple and everything on it is done exceptionally well!

They also have two tables outside and don't appear to have a public restroom. They offer the usual flavors of pizza and some unusual flavors like spicy pickle with bacon and hatch chili with pulled pork. The pizza is fresh baked to order and takes around 25 minutes to prepare but it's worth it. While your waiting you check out all the Detroit music memorabilia all around the place.

I never had Detroit Style Pizza before so I have no idea how authentic it is but I can tell you what I tried was unique and also delicious.

I tried a plain one that was personal sized. It came out very hot. The first thing I noticed was that the chunky sauce was on top of the melty cheeses. The edges are extra delicious and taste like cheese crisp crackers....the kind that are all cheese. The bottom has a thin but very crisp surface and taste almost buttery. The dough is very bubbly and not heavy. The cheese blend is very melty and flavorful and taste like it has grated Italian cheese. It was topped with rich flavorful chunky tomato sauce that was laced with the perfect amount of oregano. I thought the personal size pizza was just right for me.

4,"Waffle and crepe galore perfect for teenagers to hang out and eat delicious desserts. 

Coming in on a Friday night, their store is packed and we waited approximately 15 minutes in line for a seat, rather crammed in my opinion. Their names for their desserts are very creative - e.g. Moo La La, Interstella, Tongue Depressor, etc. Most of the prices are approximately $10-$15 for one waffle or one crepe. I didn't realize how expensive that was until I grew older and had to pay for my own bills. 

Their crepes and waffles are made very well, but for a place that specializes in desserts, I feel like they're waffles and crepes lacked a secret mystery kind of taste to it. There are secret ingredients that I know of to enhance the taste of the waffle and crepe, making it smell and taste much better than regular ingredients. 

The portion of these dishes are huge as well! Definitely a giant scoop of ice cream topped with delicious brownies or strawberries with sauce drizzled nicely over and sprinkled with icing sugar. Come in and give Demetres a try, it's pricey, but definitely a big portion.",2,6,1

3,"The breakfast and coffee at Lincoln's Haberdashery are phenomenal, but be prepared to pay a high price for the quality.  

The first thing to know is that if you don't arrive before 10am on a Saturday, you'll have a hard time getting parking in the nearby small lot or a seat for breakfast.  But if you arrive before then, be prepared for a wonderful experience.

We ordered two lattes with an extra shot in each (they normally use two shots in the medium, but we asked for three).  The coffee was the perfect strength, and wasn't too hot for immediate consumption.

For breakfast, we had one of their special doughnuts (matcha white chocolate beignet), a Mary's Muffin with avocado and cheddar (no mayo), and the Darning Egg.  Everything was delicious.  The Mary's Muffin was huge - probably 4"" in diameter.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the cheese was melty, and the muffin had butter on both sides.  It was a little hard to keep everything from falling out while eating, but it was sooo worth it.  The Darning Egg was served in a small jelly jar, and wow, it packed a flavor punch.  The potato tasted like it had onions in it, and it was nicely creamy.  The beignet donut was $6, but the cream filling was just marvelous.  

We weren't sure what to do with out plates, but we saw others bussing their own tables, so we did the same.  They do give you real plates and silverware, but the napkins are ridiculously skimpy.  They need to fit that, pronto.  

In addition to wine, the store itself has a few items, like gift cards, dog and cat toys and treats (who can't resist a stuffed La Croix dog toy?), and some mugs.  There are quite a few seats around, including a small loft area, but they were extremely busy when we left.  Like I said, get there early.  We'll be back!",1,1,1
3,"I had a surprisingly pleasant experience with Tix4Tonight.  I checked out the Tix4Tonight website to find what shows were discounted for that day and made the trek over to the Tix4Tonight booth to purchase show tickets at 30% off.  

Tix4Tonight tickets includes a wide variety of shows like Cirque shows and even buffet meal discounts.  Tix4Tonight ticket prices includes all the taxes and fees that are usually excluded at a shows box office. Before purchasing tickets, I encourage you to do your research and check the actual show's website to gauge how much the retail tickets are.

The reason for 5 stars? The great customer service I experienced. Several hours after purchasing show tickets for the evening, I realized that I had LOST the tickets. In pure panic mode, I was afraid that this was a lost cause and pretty much lost $100+. I immediately called the Tix4Tonight and explained my situation. The person I talked to asked if I had my receipt. I didn't because I lost it.  I gave her my name and the credit card information that was used to purchase the tickets. She was able to use that information to verify that I did indeed purchase through them.   She then informed me that it has been approved that  I could get my tickets re-printed at the Tix4Tonight booth.  I went to the Tix4Tonight booth and picked up tickets again with no surcharges and hassle free! 

If you want to save some $$$, I highly recommend Tix4Tonight!

Sidenote:  There are seriously three Coopers in my neighborhood with the exact same color scheme as mine.  So much for individuality.

But Dana Fredrickson (then a sales rep, now service manager) and the rest of the sales staff did what they had to do to get me into my Coop.

2,Love love love this place! Tried them out with a cut before my wedding. Anna was great and did just what I wanted. I also used her for another cut and highlights a few days before my ceremony and they just turned out amazingly. For my big day I had my short hair done by (forgive me) I believe Courtney. She did such a wonderful job. I had a trial run a month before so I knew I wanted more curls and she just created the most timeless romantic look! My makeup was done by Ari and I was also thrilled. It was expensive for me to do all this but I just wanted to feel stunning for my wedding and I did. I should also mention that my wife also had her hair and makeup done for the day and she was equally as gorgeous. I wish I had another reason to get all dolled up again. It was a lot of fun!,0,1,1

2,"Let me tell you a little something about Le Chardonnay: I have not stopped feeling warm and fuzzy about my experience there, and that was three days ago.  I wouldn't say that it's a ""hidden gem,"" because it's really in plain view on W. Johnson....but I just don't hear many people talk about it or how completely amazing it is.

It is a little plain jane from the outside, but the inside has warm wood accents, and is pretty and comfortable.  We had reservations at 6:30 on a Friday night (and I'd probably recommend you doing the same), and were seated right away.  We had a very jovial waiter who chatted us up about the weather, etc, but it didn't come off as awkward or like he was trying too hard.  It was natural and pleasant.

This is an appropriate time to mention: Le Chardonnay is the most well-oiled machine I've ever witnessed.  They had an unassuming bus boy milling about (but not in the way or imposing by any means), and as soon as you were done with a dish--bam!  It was gone!  Moments later, the waiter would reappear with your salad or entree or whatever.  He even dropped by once to refill my fiance's wine glass for him.  That's service. 

The food was fabulous, plain and simple.  A crusty french bread is served first with a nothing-short-of-miraculous spread consisting of garlic, carrots, and cumin.  It's buttery and delicious and you won't miss the real butter at all.  Your bread is then followed up by a mixed spring greens salad that isn't even mentioned in the menu (a very happy surprise to me, anyway).  We both got the Dieppoise, which is an assortment of seafood served over pappardelle pasta, smothered in a sinful saffron-cognac cream sauce.  I might not be able to pronounce ""Dieppoise,"" but I have developed a Pavlovian response to the way the word looks.  We followed dinner up with a piece of Tiramisu, which was only okay...but it didn't matter, because everything else was on a plane of existence where little cartoon birds are always fluttering overhead.  Also, I should mention that we got an excellent bottle of French Pinot Noir for $34.  None too shabby.

As I was leaving, the bus boy got my coat and PUT IT ON ME.  That was new.  And awesome.",1,1,1

I know it was a Monday morning, but since the store itself is open, it would have been nice to have cupcakes (not leftover ones from over the weekend, as explained by one of the store-owners) ready for sale too.

1,"Let me start by saying, I was very impressed.  We went at about 7pm on a Tuesday and it was not crowded at all.   I think even if it was, the service would have been excellent, however.

We started off with a couple Chopped Salads...and wow!  Easily in the top three of salads I've ever had.  Generous portions of avocado, artichoke hearts...and like ten other things with the blue cheese dressing perfectly tossed in.  If I was in a salad mood, I may well come here just for this...goodbye to Sweet Tomatoes forever!

I enjoyed the Full Rack of Pork Ribs and can say with confidence it was one of the best I've ever tried.  Very generous trimming and falling off the bone slow cooked tender with excellent sauce.  One side included, I chose the five cheese macaroni, in retrospect a pretty bland choice, but it was nicely prepared for what it was with bread crumbles on top.

My girlfriend had the wet aged Filet Mignon with creamed spinach as the side.  The steak was perfection and the spinach was a very generous portion.

6,"Dr. Bauer had great reviews and so did the facility so this is ultimately why I chose to come here. I haven't had a primary in over 2 years I think and need a referral to an ENT so I decided that I needed to develop a relationship with a Dr. and maintain it since I plan on being here for a while.

The facility is right down the street from my house so nice and convenient. It is HUGE but they have a map at the entrance of the parking lot. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the girls at the front desk. They promptly take your information and have you sign the remaining paperwork if you didn't finish it online. You then wait for another lady to take your co-pay. From what it seems this office runs like a well oiled machine, but I thought it was interesting that the woman was copying the co-pays on paper in an old fashioned receipt book. It didn't take long, so I don't really care, I just would have figured since they have online technology for their patients that they would have something for themselves.

Anyway, a nurse came and got me and did the whole vitals thing and checked height and weight and what not and then I was placed in a room to wait for Dr. Bauer. It took her about 5 minutes and she was in and introducing herself, reviewing my paperwork and talking to me about me. She was really nice and straightforward which I liked - down to business. Please don't take it for her being impersonal because it isn't, shes a busy doctor and wants to give you the best focus she can and I like that.

She checked me out and everything was fine as I knew and she also quickly gave me a referral for an ENT in the same building and had me request my old records. For a first time visit, this only took 45 minutes which was less than I was expecting.

Dr. Bauer and the staff are great and I hope when and if I need anything more serious I can prove them right even further as to how good they are. Hopefully that's not the case but I can already tell they will be awesome.",1,2,1

""I know but it's gross. I can't sit on it!""  I challenged back.

""Wait, is it a F-ING chair, or is it just a f-ing chair?"" questioned our curious male driver friend.

We roared with laughter in the back seat.

""Listen, I had to put a towel over it, THEN I could sit to draw my eyeliner on!"" I shamelessly tried to justify.  

So Wynn was great, in fact, better than great with our panaromic golf course, mountain AND city lights view on the 54th floor.  BUT there were areas with definite lack of attention.   Like my stained vanity chair.  And the sandpaper bath towels.  What did they intend to do?  Exfoliate my body with these towels?  No wonder the spa downstairs doesn't make any money.  No, actually I'm sure they do by tripling the cost of manis and pedis :) 

Overall, the bed and comforters were warm & snuggly, artwork was awful, bathroom very spacious, gambling was still fun, the atmosphere was fairly clear of secondhand smoke, the staff was courteous, the hotel was well managed, the large kiddie pool was way too shallow but the roses enroute looked and smelled absolutely beautiful.

4,"I really hope this place can take off and become a new staple in the Phoenix dance music scene. It has all the potential to become a chic yet urban yet alternative nightclub to mix with anyone and everyone who is down to get a little freaky.  The place is dark, dungeon-esque, Dom room call me mistress and spank me kind of swanky. 

Sanctum is not the biggest space for a dance club to bust out, but they made good use of what little space they have.  The bathrooms are feauture an ""open"" concept, where you don't have a door leading to either the mens or the womens (although they each have their own ""designated area"" with the urinals behind a wall, i wouldn't really consider it truly unisex) but it's a place to er..meet people... Rawr. Don't forget to wash your hands. There's some sofa room to the side of the bar where you can get in a conversation and check out the crazy artwork on the walls.  The dance floor is not the biggest and I've never seen it packed, but I'm not one to turn down an empty dance floor with a giant chandelier hanging above it.  Crazy flashing lights everywhere too...The drunk dancers dream.  The stadium-like benching to sit on is rather odd to me, but good use of space, and I'm sure there will be plenty of patrons slipping and falling to their drunken demise. behind this seating though, is where it gets really hot. the private nooks back there might get you into a bit of trouble..

Drinks are poured generously, thursday's it's no cover and 2-4-1 ALL NIGHT, and if you get there before 10 any other night you get in free.  The one thing Sanctum is missing is an after hours party...I know I could keep going til 4am.",3,5,1

Bathroom was very clean, and we lucked out with on-street parking less than a block away. Parking in this neighborhood is always a bear, but it wasn't terrible on that rainy Sunday morning.

Only thing I'd like better is if they upped the heat a little. With the open construction, it's pretty chilly. They have an airlock between double doors, but customers generally aren't very considerate about allowing the doors to close alternately. So bring a nice warm sweater!",0,0,1

There are long curtains near the door, but I don't know if they are ever opened up to block out the sun.

There are tables and chairs on the perimeter inside the tea house.  However, there is this rectangular tiled seating that my friend said reminded her of a hot tub.  It is kind of a weird area, but I can see how it would be perfect for a larger group to all sit together.

The menu is quite extensive.  Boils down to choosing what it is you are in the mood for.  I decided on a Taro Milk Tea.  It was creamy and delicious.  They will customize the sugar level, too!  They offer Cheese Foam and other toppings like boba, popping boba, jelly, & pudding.  No complaints.

This is a great place to come and hang out over a cup of tea!  I think we must have stayed for about an hour?  Parking is plentiful and free. There is a restroom here, too!  You can spot this place in a lot with a bunch of other businesses.  I would make a return visit if the option arose!",28,37,1

3,"Dr Casey .... yessssssss! Thank you miss for taking such good care of my baby boy! I was ecstatic to find she would be taking care of my baby after meeting her! She was bright, bubbly, and warm! Everything I'm looking for in the dr that will take care of my newborn son! 

We arrived 15 mins later than we were supposed to for checkin, and some way we were taken back approx 15 before I expected! The wait was comfy and quick... take it from me... I'm a mom traveling with a total of 5 yes 5 Kids! I have absolutely no complaints! 

My baby was done with his procedure in about 15-20mjns and they allowed me time to breastfeed him. I am just totally pleased with the entire experience 5+*****

3,"Creative. Delicious. Reasonably priced.  
Soho lives up to its mission of ""strip fare for locals."" They offer an inventive menu of cold and hot appetizers, entrees, and actual sushi, in addition to a well-thought-out sake list. On the waitress' recommendation, we had a bottle of the cold g fifty sake to share and it was quite good. Then we just split several appetizers, and all were seriously excellent: baked mussels, Cajun albacore, the famous yellowtail, and the black cod lettuce wraps. $75 for a great meal and drinks is fair to me. Next time, we'll definitely hit up happy hour (4-6).",2,2,1

They have multiple wall outlets for charging electronics and they also have outlets that pull down from the ceiling at their bigger table seating.

That's always a good measure on how well people can cook as how they produce egg dishes.

3,"I love that this place is hard to find! You have to go to the third floor, where all the restaurants are. Look around and find a long alleyway/corridor that is lined with framed pictures. This is your tunnel to a pizza haven. I had to ask someone where exactly it was when I saw her sitting by the pool table with a large, delicious looking pizza (as a tip, this is where you can sit when the pizza joint is filled with customers). Thankfully, I came in the afternoon so there was no line to wait in. As it was my first time, I decided to ask the workers for recommendations. We ended up getting a white pizza with mushroom and sausage, and a traditional red pizza with sausage. Both were delicious and satisfying - sometimes you just need a good slice of pizza as a break from all the rich, fine-dining type of food in Vegas. At first, I thought just one slice wouldn't be enough. But wash it down with an ice cold beer and you have yourself a meal. 

Prices were decent, $4 - 5 a slice depending on the amount of toppings you add. They have beer on draft too, which made the whole experience remind me of my undergraduate days. Overall, an excellent pizza joint for your afternoon, evening, and post-club munchie needs.",0,0,1
0,"Ambience of the place is simple but pretty good. The decor kinda reminds me of Avec in Chicago. 

Service was very good, they did well in that regard.
We had the following:

- Hamachi Bites: Loved these!!
- French Fries: Were fine but nothing spectacular
- Wings: Interesting concept stuffing shrimp in it, with a spicy touch. 
               liked it.
- Black Cod: Wasn't my favorite, and overpriced
- Pork Belly: Even if you don't like pork you'll eat this, it was good.

- Party Sandwich: Was good, nothing unique here but gets the job done to wrap up the evening.

Some others have mentioned drinks to be underwhelming. The cocktails taste good, but agreed there is too much ice in them, my wife had to sip it very slowly and then we ended up going somewhere else for more cocktails with greater portion. 

Good place to try for sure, between 2 people, with 2 drinks, 6-7 dishes, tax/tip etc you are looking no less than $200. It's on the pricey side so if you're gonna spoil yourselves go for it.",0,0,1
1,"Delicious but pricey Chinese food (but hey, what else do you expect in Vegas?)

The restaurant is located in ARIA. We had a bit of a hard time finding it since there weren't any signs and it wasn't in the lobby area, but we asked around and was directed to walk through the casino from the lobby, and it was on the right once we walked far enough.

My friend had made a reservation beforehand for Sunday dinner at 7 pm. I'd definitely recommend a reservation, as it was pretty empty when we first arrived but was mostly filled out by the time we left around 8:30.

A couple of us ordered cocktails, which were $16. I went with the mandarin orange, which was vodka based and had a lovely watermelon flavor. I tried a sip of my friend's mango chili-lime and the matcha spice, but the mandarin orange was by far my favorite if you like fruity flavors like me.

For food we ordered:

Steamed sea bass ($42): the sea bass was served on top of tofu. The sea bass was really fresh, but the main flavor came from the black bean sauce sprinkled on top, which didn't have quite enough flavor to cover the whole dish. Portions were also really small for the price

Spicy veal cheek ($35): it's not actually that spicy, which is a lot coming from me since I have zero spice tolerance. The meat was flavorful and tender. My second favorite dish of the night

Garlic prawn fried rice ($20): this was really good! Favorite dish of the whole table

Pan fried pea shoots ($25): solid veggie dish, but again, I couldn't believe how much we were paying for this dish

Service was solid, as you would expect from a high end place like this.

It was ~$60 pp for dinner + one cocktail.",1,1,1

The shawarma plate is piled high with home made sides. Rice or roasted potato for your carbs,  and salad with cucumbers and tomato with homemade dressing. The hummus is made in-house and is very fresh and also so, so good!

The chicken is perfectly spiced, roasted to perfection and there is a *ton* of it. you get a nice mix of juicy and crispy bits.

The wrap is similarly generous. They are absolutely stuffed with toppings and chicken. If you walk away hungry i'd be very surprised.

I couldn't wait to try Buck & Rider, and now that I have, I can't wait to return!  This hot new seafood centric restaurant has only been open for a week, but you wouldn't know it based on our experience.

My husband and I enjoyed an early dinner date night at newly opened B&R tonight and had a fun and memorable meal.  It's group service, but Mia was our main server and did a fabulous job!  

We enjoyed sharing the following:
-a half dozen oysters
-snapper ceviche
-lobster roll
-calamari

It was all fresh and delicious, and paired perfectly with the glass of wine (Domaine Serge Les Boursicote Sancerre) I selected.  It's worth noting that they also offer a solid cocktail list for all of you cocktail connoseiurs ;)

We sat inside but right on the border of the outdoor patio... We enjoyed an almost perfect view of Camelback mountain.  I say ""almost perfect"" as there is also a view of a Jack in the Box sign that gets in the way ;)

The bathrooms are spacious, clean, and classy, as is the architecture of the restaurant; all fitting of the inspiration behind the space; a house located in a swanky beach town on the Australian coast.

In addition to complimentary valet, B&R offers patrons LGO's signature sea salt chocolate chip cookies on your way out... it is the perfect sweet ending to your meal.  

For now B&R is open for dinner only, 6 days a week (closed Monday).  I hope they will extend their hours into lunch soon.  This is definitely a welcome addition to the 'hood!",6,24,1

This place wasn't short of great. From the ambience to the food, I loved every bit of it. 

Here is what we ordered:
Braised Short Rib Burger w/ an upgrade of truffle fries
- damn this was good. I ordered it medium, and the patty was juicy and thick just how it should be. It was supposed to come with thick cut fries, but I gotta have my truffle so I upgraded it to a side of truffle fries. I'm glad i did! The fries were so good! So crispy on the outside + it came with some sort of lemony aoli lol 

Braised Short Rib
- we love our red meat  this was delicious! The Rib was SOOOO tender. It just melts in your mouth. 

To top off the great entrees, they serve complimentary bread. We chose the honey cornbread and oh my god, I had to have seconds. The outside had a honey crisp and it was warm and soft in the middle. Put some butter on that b*%%! and BAM.

My only slight complaint would be that I wish our main waiter was more... smiley? Lol he sort of looked like he was over it. Other than that, everything was great. Can't wait to come back!

Everything is made like your Great Aunt would do it if, of course, she was from Kabul, Afghanistan and if she was following cherished family recipes and if she were using only the finest ingredients.  Just taste the rice and you will know what I mean.  Then try any of the expertly spiced and prepared meats.  You will be hooked.

Khalid was not there this afternoon but Tommie was and he was just as gracious. 

I go to Kabob Express when I want a great meal for an incredible price and when I want to impress a friends or family.  It truly is a bonus that the prices are so low.",1,1,1

Thanks to my fearless wife spending over an hour on the phone and over an hour online chatting with Verizon representatives, I walked I to this store and met the right person to finish hooking up my line and watch after leaving T-Mobile. The staff was pleasant and quick to serve us.",0,0,1
0,This was a great Hilton hotel in Las Vegas. It did not have any gambling within the place so you did not have the extensive crowds in music and annoyance of a gambling establishment. It was right next to the flamingo so if you are entertained by gambling is still next-door. But it was very convenient location and they do a great job of keeping the place up I was very impressed with the rooms.,0,0,1
0,"The BEST restaurant (other than Verde and Dressler's, and I'm sure Viva Chicken up here will rock like the Charlotte location) in the Huntersville area.  Service is great.  Casey isn't there any longer (he opened up a drafthouse in Cornelius), but another awesome server is Taylor.  Have bartender Zack make you a Maker's Manhattan, low-ball, large ice cube.  None better.  The rest of the bartenders... eh, it's hit or miss.  The food is great quality.  You get what you pay for, and I have no problem having a slightly higher bill and leaving after a great meal and service at this place.",0,0,1
1,"There are not many places that sell Boba in the Phoenix Valley in general, so this becomes a luxury item whenever I am in the area.  They have a variety of tea drinks, smoothies, Vietnamese coffee, and much more.  The prices are pretty standard and you can add lychee jelly, boba, or many other small supplements to the drink for a nominal extra charge.  

Many places put a heavy amount of sugars to their tea drinks, but they don't overwhelm you with sweetness, but it is the right amount to give good flavors.",0,0,1

8,"I always wanted too try this place since close too my house. I heard only great reviews about it plus my roommate gone and rave about the B Reuben. My first impression was this place is really cool. I LOVE the earth tone colors on the walls and funny pics of smiling vegetable on the menu board. The tables each one has flowers on them so not just plain table and chairs! Well light brings out all the positive and relaxing vibe of the restaurant. I went into the same location before when it was called Harold Kitchen. It SO much more upgrade in decor and hopefully Presto Cafe will stick around. 

I decided too have the B Reuben and try on of there salads. It basically a la carte. The salads or basically sides look really good, fresh, and they let you try any or all of them if want.. I enjoy the way all the sides are presented right in front of you. Nice clean, easy too read description card in front of each one, and not just salad have desserts all lined up presented in the same fashion. I went with the israel couscous, wild mushrooms, parm, truffle vinaigrette as my side salad. 

The B Reuben is by FAR just topped my old best Reuben at Steiners hand down. It looks delicious, fresh, and you just want too manga. The Raisin Rye Bread is so good! It got perfect grill mark from panini press style, toasted perfection nice crispy, and get that toasted crust first thing bite into then rest is unreal. The red cabbage (most places it typical sauerkraut) slaw so much flavor, gruyere cheese, julienne carrots, and russian dressing brings everything full circle. The corned beef nice hot, moist, and could tear up corned beer by itself!!!! I so agree with Misti its Reuben ecstasy next thing know done and not that big of sandwich but good thing got salad. The salad was just as amazing as the sandwich. The israel cous cous is cooked perfectly. The wild mushroom, fresh parm, and all tossed in black truffle vinaigrette. Black truffle oil and mushroom is like peas in pod. They just go hand in hand. It perfect side dish and between both perfect lunch not too heavy but just right! 

The service was top notch from first step in the place was greeted with warm welcome. She explained too me the whole menu, whether it was my first time visit,  and went over the salads. If wanted too try anyone of the salads. She brought out my lunch. She checked up on me during my lunch. You even get dollar off your bill check in on Yelp. Dam it! Between Buldogi and Presto Cafe nice know that restaurant and cares about us Yelpers! 

Without doubt plan on coming back again! =) Lot more of the menu looking forward too checking out.",0,2,1

My other friend is on a low sugar low carb diet and she asked for a vodka soda, they stated they don't normally do that but to accommodate her they did and that was really nice.

Food wise, the menu is HUGE. There is a ton of secret hidden menu 'hints' in between menu items, under menu items, bottom of the menu, middle of the menu, everywhere! I could've read the menu for 30 minutes and still missed something. It is truly a menu designed for you to have your breakfast exactly how you want it. 

I got the breakfast burrito, wasn't super impressed and I was torn between that and a scramble. Service was awesome, a woman named Sarah stopped by several times and laughed with us and it was just a great brunch! They close at 2:00 and we accidentally stayed until 2:45 but nobody made us feel pressured to leave so we didn't even realize the place was closing! I'd love to come back again.",0,0,1
3,"I've been wanting to try V's since reading the write-up in Scene Magazine and reading the Yelp reviews.  This place is less than 15 minutes from home and is in such an unassuming location, I probably would never have stopped had I not seen the rave reviews.  I decided to have V's for Sunday dinner.  I called in my order, as the on-line menu recommends.  I was told that the order would be ready in approx. 30 minutes, so I timed my arrival accordingly.  The wait was a bit longer than promised, but no complaints, because the food is definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the 8 piece family meal.  8 pieces of chicken (2 of each piece), 2 large sides (I ordered mashed potatoes & gravy, corn and an extra large side of mac n cheese, and a small side of rice & greens). The meal also comes with your choice of bread.  I opted for the honey biscuits.   As other Yelp reviewers have commented, the chicken is AWESOME!   There are a number of options for coating, I chose the seasoned which was tasty.  The chicken was tender, juicy and the outer crust was crunchy and flavorful.  There was nothing that I didn't like about the chicken, and it was very evident that it had been cooked to order.  The sides were average to above average, although I did really enjoy the rice & greens, nice flavor combination.  The honey biscuits....OMG, warm, fluffy biscuits, drizzled in honey.  The biscuits were more like dessert, very tasty.   My total bill was $28.00, and I have a boatload of leftovers, for another meal.   I'll definitely return to V's.....soon!",0,0,1

When I came back the next week for my tattoo, Nate was helpful and open with the whole tattoo process.  I could tell right away that he takes great pride in doing good work.  When I was finished, Nate told me how to care for it, what to do, and what to avoid.  He was great.

0,"Having recently moved to Phoenix, this is my favorite place to eat out here so far. The area looks a little sketchy, but maybe only because I've always gone after it's already dark out. I've been here three or four times and they have never disappointed! Someone has been outside the door greeting every time I have visited. Even when we had to wait to be seated, we were given menus to look over while we waited. They are always busy and with good reason!

My family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.

We ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous. 

We all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty. 

The prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees.

Let me say this I have been here at least six time so far and every time the food has been consistently good. I can't even say that about my three most favorite restaurants.

4,"Yonaka is, surprisingly, my first foray into the upper tier of Japanese cuisine in Las Vegas. With one small exception, it did not disappoint.

I brought my mom and aunt here for happy hour. I had a bit of a faux pas in that I went ahead and used the OpenTable service through Yelp to make a reservation, but I did not realize that it's a reservation for a table instead of bar seating or a booth, which are the two areas that you are allowed to sit at for the happy hour menu. They were gracious enough to allow us to relocate to a booth, thankfully. (By the way, the booth area isn't like that of a typical restaurant since it's practically in the middle of the room.)

You know by now that they call themselves modern and Japanese, and they deliver on both points. The restaurant itself prominently features a sushi bar, but it's also built with a pleasing wood aesthetic and isn't too dark or too bright. The food itself ranges from almost traditional sushi items to inspired combinations of both familiar and unusual ingredients. The service was also very thoughtful in that they gave us the cold items before the hot plates and, with the exception of a pile-up at the end, 

Without further ado, a breakdown of the food:

- Complimentary amuse bouche: a cucumber cube topped with a chunk of cherry tomato and a hint of salt. Pleasant, and a sign of good things to come.

- Avocado nigiri: one piece of sushi rice, with avocado slices on top and a small nori wrap. Citrus and soy sauce flavors were present, and a re-reading of the menu reviews that yuzu kosho and tamari are included. I'll be honest and say that I thought the tamari was soy sauce, but I guess I'll have to come back some time to determine the difference.

- Sake orenji: this is our one order not from the happy hour menu. It is something that you kinda need to try though, and when our server reminded me about it, I was happy to go for it. There's about 5 or 6 pieces of salmon, an equal amount of orange slices, a fantastic sauce, some yuzu tobiko topping, and baby arugula on the very top. It's just a fantastic medley of flavors.

- Negitoro: bluefin tuna belly and scallions presented in a nori-encased roll, six pieces' worth. Quite good. Need to make sure to use restraint on the soy sauce, but I guess that's what I get for becoming too accustomed to the low sodium bottle on my sushi adventures...

- Complimentary palate cleanser: sliced and slightly sweetened fruits, including peach, mango, apple, strawberry. I have no idea if this actually cleansed anything, but it was nice.

- Corn urchin: it's a new menu item and a new happy hour addition. In my opinion, it should have been called Uni Corn. I would have laughed. Anyway, it was bound to please me because it's a combination of my childhood favorite food with one of my new ""grown-up"" favorites. There were four sections of corn on the cob, each topped with uni-miso butter, a reasonable piece of uni, and negi. It's finger food, and it's really good.

- Chuka buns: not sure why the server kept pronouncing it ""Chuku."" It's not so important though. I won't bother describing it because it was mediocre relative to everything else tonight and, more importantly, does not come close to matching my favorite pork belly bun at Fat Choy. I would strongly recommend skipping this unless you read the ingredients and are enamored with all of them.

- Crispy hen: another of my favorites. Four pieces of cornish hen. The crispy skin seems almost infused with sweet chili, and the pickled vegetables, though not strictly consistent with traditional Vietnamese flavor, bring welcome freshness.

- Tsutsumi: the server presents this in a clay pot and quickly breaks and stirs an egg into the mixture of mushrooms with pork belly and ear. Apparently, you're supposed to wrap it in the lettuce, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it and just settled on munching on the lettuce and the mix separately. It's a satisfying treat if you're a fan of pork ear. I do wish that I hadn't gotten lettuce that was slightly reddened from age, though. They should be able to find a more pristine leaf.

- Shioyaki saba: one mackerel. Firm meat with optional lemon (pretty sure somebody squeezed a little too much) and cucumber chunks. I'll need to try this again some time since it's supposed to be hot but was kinda cold by the time I got to it.

- Beet fries: sweet chunks of fried beet with an apparently homemade mayo, rosemary, and sea salt. Came out at the end because we made a last-minute add. That mayo complements the beet very well.

Surprisingly, that was it. I'm really glad we were all still pretty full from earlier in the day. The portions all seem fairly modest, and I don't see myself ordering too often from the regular menu. But I'll probably go for happy hour again if I can find a companion. You should definitely make the trip out here at least once if you're a local or if you're an out-of-towner with an appreciation of Japanese cuisine.",3,3,1

To my surprise over the years the pizza has remained better than expected and the Chuck E. Cheese show on the main stage is such a great way to get the kids and families with Birthday engaged!! I like how they have classic videos that the kids like and animation to help reel in the kids attention.

Party prizes and about the same like many of the competitors so your not gaining or missing out on anything. I do like how you have some chances (when part of the birthday parties) to win some big number tickets worth 100, 200, and 1000's so the kids can get some cool things. 

If your looking to plan an easy low key party this is a good location. And just like all other Chick e cheeses, they do a good job stamping the kids and parents and monitoring the door with designated staff...",1,2,1

0,"I liked this place a lot - their Tonkatsu Ramen was very tasty and in my experience it's difficult to get good ramen in Arizona. They offer to bring out a side of their homemade hot sauce to put into the ramen which is called Spice Bomb - but it's sooooo hot! I just tasted it with my chopsticks and it burned away those taste buds. Our waitress said it's very popular though so who knows - maybe mixed in it isn't so hot?
I like the location at Scottsdale Quarter right across from Dominick's and H&M. The inside decor is nice and relaxing. 
The only thing I didn't like was I sat at the few tables that backed up against the people sitting at the bar. So while the bar seats were high, our tables were low so I was back to back with someone sitting at the bar - but much lower because I was at a regular heigh table. But anywhere else in the restaurant wouldn't have that problem. I will request to sit somewhere else next time.",0,1,1

This is a fav spot for my boyfriend and I, he loves his martini's with blue cheese olives (trust me, they are hard to find in restaurants). Our favorite appetizer is the Kilt Lifter fondue and you can't pass up their infamous chicken chopped salad.

1,"Wow was I happy there was an accident and I was forced to take a detour. I went home early from work as I was catching a nasty cold... the traffic was making it worse, so I hit the Garmin's detour button and it took me down Matthews-Pineville road and then  I remembered the reviews for this restaurant. 

So in I went. I was the first person to get there... I was worried at first, but soon I forgot it as the servers that greeted me were full of smiles. 

They led me to a booth and brought me water and hot tea as asked. 

I looked over the menu - not being hunger I didn't really take a full gander of the menu, I knew exactly what I wanted for this cold, HOT and SOUR soup to burn the germs. 

I then saw they had the wontons I had been wanting to try... I believe they were called Spicy Schezwan Wonton served over spicy oil sauce and garnished with cilantro and sesame seeds... 

Can I just tell you how much I enjoyed my meal. My server as if everything was ok and if it were too hot for me... I said I loved both and because of my cold, I crave spicy food to cure me... which by the way, I went to work the next day feeling 100% better.

The club lounge is open on the weekends which is great when you have to leave early and go to the office on these days too. Also, the rooms are very spacious and clean. The gym is very modern and even provides exercise routines for business travelers.  The rooms have a great view of the falls and so does the restaurant.

Everyone was great at this hotel but I will point out at check-in I had a younger girl who had just started. She was kind of unprofessional when I asked her about a platinum award issue that she didn't address and was very rude with her answer. Usually if you don't know the answer, you will find out for someone and not just say you don't know. Everyone else there was FANTASTIC and made me feel like it was truly my home away from home.

The waitress was extremely friendly and my tea never got under 3/4 full. They use jasmine in their iced tea, which gave it a fresh taste that was amazing! The fried rice had fresh tomato, cucumber, carrots, and basil. I love how they left the veggies fresh and didn't stir fry them into the fried rice. The veggies were sooo fresh, I've never had fried rice with such fresh veggies. The fried rice was extra spicy, just like I asked. Best authentic Thai food in town. If you're a stuck up snob who cares about decor, order it to go or go to some hip new Japanese fusion restaurant in town with mediocre food. If you like good food, eat here.

I went with a simple order of garlic Cheese Bread and it was freakin huge and came with marinara and garlic sauce all for 5 bucks.

The food is bloody amazing. As a Brit in America it really is nice to be shown how BBQ is really done. The moist brisket is ridiculously nice but it is also brilliant that you get the lean option on the menu. I can come here if my friends go and don't feel bad for eating the lean brisket.

My problem when I come here is that I don't have a big enough stomach for all the things I want to eat. The potato salad is gorgeous and the hot sausage is my absolute favourite. I feel that if I ate here more often that I would have some serious health issues as when I leave my stomach is like a beach ball and I come out around 15 lbs heavier than when I went in.

Outside the restaurant has a wood type design and it makes the restaurant look a bit incomplete but I assure you its a completely finished restaurant. Nice and spacious. This restaurant replaces Nak Won. Poor Nak Won :(

My dad was complaining the whole time about the first impressions of the restaurant. The outside looks unfinished. There is not enough variety on the menu. He didn't like how all the cups were different. He wanted tea to be served instead of just boiled water. He didn't like how all the chairs in the restaurant looked different. He thought the tables were cheap. And he kept on going on and on. Some of the things he pointed out may hold true but once he began eating his dish the complaining stopped and he even had some good things to say about the food. 

My dad got the beef with rice (Gyu rice) $8.50 - There is a lot going on when you take a closer look at the dish. Other than the beef and rice there was avocado, thinly sliced apple, ginger, a nice runny boiled egg and on the side a miso soup. 

I got the curry beef with rice (Curry Gyu rice) $8.95 - This dish had all the same as the above dish but with curry sauce which had some potatoes and carrots. I thought the dish tasted excellent and gives stiff competition for the restaurant Donburi. My only complaint is that the dish could be a bit larger for us big eaters out there :) 

Also got a chance to try the beef udon (Gyu udon) $9.50 - It had many of the same items as above. (sliced apple, avocado, runny boiled egg but in addition it had corn on the cob and tofu. The udon was cooked perfectly. Not too soft or hard but just the right amount of chew. 

Another dish we got was the seafood udon $11.95 - There was veggie, squid and shrimp tempura on the side. The shrimp tempura was very large and tasty. 

To top it off we tried a hot taro milk tea for $2 - The cup was huge and was filled to the top. We shared it among three people it was so large. Great value at $2 but I think this might be special grand opening pricing. Drink was nice and sweet and tasted pretty good.

Yes I had a drip drop a dripping drop. In a area near the entrance of the house. Every time it rained. I couldn't take the drip anymore. I looked on yelp for a roof repair business. I called a roofing business got their machine left multiple messages and never got a call back. Beware of roofing places that advertise discount roofing hmmmm.. customer service is following up as well. I called for two days leaving my number. So, when I called this lovely place I was really doubting if I would get great service. I am so glad that I did!! The representative came in a white truck and had his own ladder. I showed him the water marks near my entrance and he went to work on the roof taking pictures and making notes. My quote was ready within a week. I put half down  before work was done. I was at work when I received multiple calls about men on my roof. Thank you neighborhood watch. I have learned to tell my neighbors before I get work done. They really watch out. However, the roofers did an excellent job. I watched my roof all summer to make sure it didn't leak. And!!! Yaaaasssss!!! Thank you so much! I am so grateful that y'all answered the phone, were professional, friendly and took care of the roof so well. We've had some brutal storms here and I just smile because I KNOW my roof is secure. Again please forgive me for taking so long. Thank you !! I got no more drip drop dripping drop.",0,0,1

I don't have any serious skin ailments but whenever I need something, I don't hesitate to reach out to this location. At the end of each visit, I make sure to ask for the complimentary chemical peel! They've taken me from the lowest percentage and increased me responsibly. I am slightly embarrassed to ask for it but I gotta keep my skin lookin' right! I have visited 4 times now and I have NOT been disappointed.",0,0,1

Think of this place as the Michael's for dudes.

Aisle after aisle of craft beers. 
Handles of everything including Jager.
And when they say Total Wine, they're not kidding. I saw wines from practically every country in the world except maybe Somalia or those really sandy, oily countries. 

They even have a tasting room, which you'll want to get the schedule app'd into your Iphone like right now.

It's a tiny place, and I was hoping it would be a bit busier for lunch, just because the rest of the shopping center is deserted for the most part. At least we could sit down right away and get started eating! All of their rolls are reasonably priced, as well as their lunch combos. I had the salmon teriyaki combo along with a spicy salmon roll. It was excellent- such a treat getting fresh food! The vegetable tempura wasn't overly greasy.The miso was a little on the salty side, but I can forgive since it was all so wonderful.

3,"Definitely my place of choice to get some good Thai food on campus.  I usually go for the Pad Thai or Pad See Ewe with chicken, but their other noodle dishes as well with their curries and rice dishes are also tasty.  There is also a good selection for if you are vegetarian (you can replace any of the meat with tofu or mixed vegetables).  Can't say I'm a big fan of their noodle soups though - I find them kind of bland. 

Price-wise, at $6/$7 a dish, it costs approximately the same as if you were to grab lunch on Green St., but this is definitely the place to go to sit back, relax, catch up with friends, study, etc. while grabbing a bite to eat if you have some extra time.

While they do tend to err on the greasy side, I have never been dissatisfied with an order, and their friendly service coupled with the clean, open decor (much nicer than their sister location on Green St.) is very refreshing compared to many of the grungy feeling restaurants/cafes around campus and keeps me coming back.",0,0,1

I'm a little confused why slim jim's (sun devil stix) are on the menu, as well as a grilled cheese and tomato soup... ok I like grilled cheese and soup, but not really at a bar. That doesn't exactly say upscale bar food, that says more like I'm naked on the couch watching Fast Times at Ridgemont High and I've got the munchies whats in the kitchen?

It's worth it to come here just for the loft, where you have some privacy with tables spaced apart and a great view of the street scene from the large storefront windows.

3,"My review is based solely on cycling classes as I've never done anything else at FSY. I love that I can sign up ahead of time so I don't have to show up ridiculously early to get a spot. Classes always start on time which I really appreciate as well. I can get in, burn some serious calories, and get out in under an hour. There are 2 decent showers and a small but clean locker room/restroom. The instructors are all high energy, honest, and fun--each with their own style. 

The only negative points for me are their current online system for account management/class signup and the new pricing. I was able to keep my old rate ($89/month) but everyone I've brought in since the March 2016 price change (using the 4 for $4) has said they LOVE FSY but it's out of their budget now. Cycle is now $139/month. Fitness is now $139/month. Or you can get both for $236/month. Steep increase. I wouldn't be able to afford the new pricing but if money isn't an issue for you, it's fun and you'll get a good workout. 

I believe they give a student discount but not miltary, LE, fire, or EMT discount.",0,1,1

So, I was thinking.....of all the places to eat in Vegas - you want to have hot wings???? OMG, now I know why. 

I've eaten a lot of buffalo hot wings in my lifetime, but I must say - the Spicy Garlic flavor at Buffalo Wild Wings were BANGIN'!!! The chicken was fried just right. The skin was crispy enough and the meat moist. The sauce was spicy but there was still a lot of flavor to savor. There were a variety of sauces to choose but I chose the Spicy Garlic for my first try. 

The prices are good and the menu simple, great beer selection. When you're in the mood to just have a straight forward meal - this is the place to go, plus the big screen TV's are a bonus when there's a good game goin' on. I'm bummed, the closest location to San Diego is Murrieta!!!!!!!!!",0,0,1

We left the restaurant with full stomachs unable to eat dessert which is unheard of for us..anyways im definitely coming back for sure. 

The only thing i was gripe about is the info shows casual attire..well casual to me is just that casual..i went with jeans and nice shirt and shoes and my hat..they asked me to take off my hat at the dinner table which i dont mind doing ..but dont say its casual attire then. i say it should have a classy title than casual",0,0,1

Everyone in my part noticed the attitude but didn't let it ruin our meal.

The plan was to go to Swensens with lawn chairs and blankets and eat our meal sitting on the grass next to the parking lot.  What a wonderful summer evening treat!  

Hubby and I had never been to Swensens before, so the very focused running servers were a little intense, but efficient.  

Between the six of us (four adults, two kids) we ate our way through the menu with burgers, fries, a hot dog, BLT, grilled cheese, fried zucchini, potato teezers, tater tots, and an assortment of beverages.  Not a disappointing bite in the bunch! 

Nice job for being fast food!  It's obvious there is heart behind Swensen's food, and a well-oiled machine for service and customer satisfaction.

4,"We decided to give this place a try to celebrate my wife's birthday. 

While I know that one of the reasons why people come to Vegas is to gamble and this hotel has no casino, it was still a great experience. 

First off the hotel is a nonsmoking hotel, so that meant that if I was gonna get dressed all nice for a dinner I did not need to worry about getting all smoky going from my hotel room to my car. Although if you do want to gamble the mgm is accessible through a secure walkway and it's about a five to ten minute walk to the casino. 

Secondly, the hotel is valet only. I know this sounds strange that this is a perk. When vegas is charging you for parking, why not spend the same money for tipping the valet guy and having them bring you your car. In addition, I love the fact that when I get of my car the elevators to my room is about a 100 feet away. Usually when you valet or self park you still have about a 5 to 10 minute walk just to get to your room. Another thing that I love is the security, in order to drive into the hotel you need to be a guest, there is a secure drive way and to enter the hotel from the mgm casino you also need a key to get in.

Lastly, the hotel staff is on point. From the security at the front gate, front desk, valet and concierge service, everyone made us feel like we were important and appreciated. We want to stay at this hotel the next time we come to Vegas.",1,1,1

What a great freakin idea!! Free video games while you drink!! SCORE!! We had so much fun!! We played the pac-man battle it's a 4 player game so it worked out perfect, we played the simpsons, theres a racing game, so many fun options!!

The good: very strong beefy flavor, very generous portions of beef, double than other pho places, beef very sliced very thin and was tender.

The bad: a bit on the salty side, the spice flavor was very subtle (star anise, cinnamon, etc.) which was probably overwhelmed by the beef flavor.  Price was a bit higher and it takes a little longer for the food to come out.

A week ago I stood by her bedside ready to give her my liver. My wife was on-deck for the kidneys. 

Our dog became extremely ill in less then half an hour. Couldn't walk and was unable to hold her head up. Sudden and scary. We called Boca Park Animal Hospital - where we have been taking R all her life. Kim told us to come right down...they'd be waiting. 

Dr. Gibson saw R as we arrived and was completely involved from that moment on....explaining possible causes, reviewing the range of tests, the costs (as well as what they would and would not tell us) conservative to aggressive options, etc.  Her knowledge, manner and professionalism helped us deal with a very scary situation. When I was out of town she called me to make sure that I was on track with everything. I never got that from my child's pediatrician! 

The entire staff at Boca Park Animal Hospital provided us with truly remarkable care and support the entire time R was in there.  Follow-up calls were made to my wife when, and as, promised. When R's condition changed updates were provided to my wife and care taken to make sure she understood them and had all the information to make decisions. 

Important note: This story would be the same if any of the doctors at BPAH had seen R. We (and our extended family) have had outstanding treatment from Dr's' Hill, Anderson and Ensign.

Dr. Ensign is to be complimented for his ability to put together such a great team - at all levels. The overall, ongoing consistancy and superior care for patients and owners doesn't ""just happen.""

Fast-food that went semi organic and high end.

Some of their burgers with blue cheese r not my favorite. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other by taste even if their names sound very different hence 4 stars. I personally believe Burgers can be taken to any level. 

Bar program is good. It's a fun ambience.

4,"So I may be biased a bit. I am a teacher at CorePower and btw I am in my 40's. I tend to practice and teach at night, though I do come on the weekends as well. So first and foremost the clientele is all different ages, I love this and we strive hard to create a true community. We offer 4 different types of classes majority of which are 60 minutes, 3 out of the 4 are heated and 3 out of the 4 are sequenced. I first came to my yoga mat in Denver at CorePower, upon moving back to Arizona I could not find a comparable format or studio. So I made due and traveled a lot around the valley.  We have been open since September of 2015 and while we do have clientele from ASU, we also have a Tempe studio opening up this Month (March 2016) right across from ASU. Guess what you get your first week free, no other studio does that. Trust me I know (remember above the traveling I talked about).  With that being said come give it a try and hey guess what when you join one CorePower you can use them all. Oh we have showers (3 for women and a couple for the men), free supplies (like mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, hairdryer, deodorant, hair ties) and towels, water, mats, clothing if you need them. We also offer challenges that motivate.",0,0,1
7,"This is my current cheap Asian buffet champ...I've had numerous visits through the years, but after my current visit on a busy Saturday night warrants a review..

Krazy Service:  Party of 14 and we were able to get seated under 15 minutes, one table for the kids and another for the adults.  Our server kept all the drinks fresh throughout the night.  She stopped by at least every 10 minutes it seemed, very cool. 

Krazy Buffet:  All the items you'd find at panda express and your local mom and pop Chinese restaurant you'll find at Krazy buffet.  Add in some seafood, sushi and some soups and you have a lot of options to choose from. Here are my favs at Krazy buffet:  Beef & mushroom- The beef was very tender and flavorful. I went up for 3 plates, and this found it's way on my plate all 3 times.  Cream cheese rangoons: Tasty and lots of cheese were in each rangoon.  Pork Bun - Flavorful and packed with more pork than I expected.  Honey Walnut Shrimp - Perfect blend of mayo and honey.  This is an easy dish to mess up and they do it well here.

There's not much ambiance as the dining area is designed to pack as many customers as possible which I don't mind.  For a $13.99 dinner buffet, Krazy offers some amazing value for the quality and selection of dishes you're offered.  If you come here with reasonable expectations for the price, I think you'll leave satisfied.  If I lived on this side of town, I would definitely visit more frequently.  enjoy!",2,4,1

0,"By far one of the top Shanghai restaurants I've been to in Toronto, good for large family gatherings, too.

Came here with a family of four on a weekend. It didn't take too long for us to be seated which was good. The place itself was huge; close to the size of a dim sum restaurant. Decor was also quite modern for what you would expect with a Shanghai restaurant. You could also see the kitchen in the back through the glass which was pretty cool to see them cooking and making the dishes.

We ordered the Xiao long bao, 2 different flavours (original pork and crab), followed by the fried rice cake, egg whites with broccoli, sour and spicy soup, noodles in broth with shredded pork and nappa cabbage, plain stir Chinese broccoli, deep fried bun with condensed milk, spicy stir fried pork, deep fried egg whites with red bean and sugar. 

The restaurant name itself, their Xiao long bao were definitely good. I preferred the pork over the crab. The inside was very juicy and meat was tender and flavourful. Must try here if you're into this dish. The fried rice cake was nothing out of the ordinary though, a bit greasy actually. Egg whites with broccoli was delicious - broccoli wasn't too raw or overcooked; expect this one to be a bit on the greasy side since egg whites require more oil to cook in order for it to not stick to the pan. Sour and spicy soup wasn't bad either, the sourness and spiciness was pretty balanced. Noodles with shredded pork and nappa cabbage was... what it is. Not much to say there besides a nice clean dish - might be good for vegetarians minus the meat. Chinese broccoli was crisp and fresh. Deep fried bun with condensed milk was simple yet good; the bun wasn't over fried and the center was nice and soft. The stir fried pork was a bit salty, although there were a lot of ingredients in there; would go nicely with plain white rice. Last but not least, dessert - a must order when you go to a Shanghai restaurant is the deep fried egg whites with red bean. They are only good if they come to you hot and these ones did not disappoint. The amount of red bean was not skimpy (some restaurants do because they cheap out) which made it a nice ending to a satisfying meal.

Give this place a try if you're in Scarborough as it's pretty close and accessible.",0,0,1
2,"Great experience. They got me in same-day with Denise Craig. As a new patient, she did a very thorough background review and discussed all my concerns. She addressed everything that came up in a friendly and professional manner. I actually felt like I was respected as a patient, which is pretty rare with doctors lately. She even suggested some tests for some general concerns I had (other doctors have blown me off with concerns such as anxiety, bruising, and fatigue). The annual pap was about as comfortable and painless as one of them can be, the staff was all friendly, the wait time was minimal.

4,"So driving along 16th Street going north towards camelback, it's interesting that I've passed by Joes countless of times not realizing it's a diner. ho hum, you learn something new everyday especially in Phoenix. lol. Anywho, went to breakfast with my friend Sara V. and was lucky to get a parking spot. We went there at around 10, and were seated promptly, I'm guessing this place is not the best spot for groups larger than 4 since most of the diner is made up of booths, didn't see many free standing tables. 

So the menu isn't large, it has its basics, omelettes, sandwiches, pancakes, a few combo generics like pork loin and eggs, chicken fried steak and eggs, corn beef hash and so forth. I got myself the chicken fried steak with eggs (over medium) and a short stack of pancakes. Also, got an apple juice and I should have asked if it was the actual juice and not the cider, it was the cider and altho it's not my fave, i drank it. The service wasn't slow at all, the staff was busy yet friendly, we even had Joe in his chef pants (I didn't know they were chef pants until Sara V. told me they were, I thought the pattern and fabric looked weird) ask how we were. *nice touch* It's great that Joe connects with his customers. =) (okay that's a star!)

Anyways the food came, and the chicken fried steak was alright not the best, and yes, I've had better, and the potatoes with the plate were alright but for two stars alone are the pancakes. YUMMMMMMMMMMM! they're crispy, and so freaking good with the butter and syrup... delish! I'll come back to Joes for the pancakes coz that's where the money's at. Overall good service - a star, delicious pancakes - two stars and Joe connecting with his customers, another star = 4 stars.

We were mostly in the back which was pretty much all about breaking a groove and the space to get down to ice cube and pump up to Sizzla.

Good for groups and $15 cover. Hieni & Miller is pricey here but the girly drinks are pretty alright. Bartenders are shockingly polite and they don't ignore you.

2,"After my horrible experience at Nu Sanctuary last night, dining at Grimaldi's was like being treated to a five star restaurant. Service was top notch. Our experience from the time we walked in to the time we left was impeccable.

Our server, Ray, was friendly and asked us if we have been to the restaurant before or if it was our first time. It was our first time so he took the time to explain the menu and how their coal brick oven creates perfectly charred thin crust. We decided to skip appetizers and go straight to pizza. 

We ordered a large white pizza with garlic, one half with ricotta and basil and the other half with pesto and grilled chicken.  The crust was so delicious and charred just right. I was surprised that it wasn't greasy at all. 

Ray was great about checking on us and refilling drinks at the right times.  He even cleaned the crumbs off our table before our dessert came out. It really did feel like five star service!

He recommended the cheesecake which they bake in house. I am so glad we ordered it. It was creamy and was the right amount of sweetness. It was the perfect way to end the meal.

I love how service was prompt and friendly. It was obvious that their restaurant was like a well oiled machine because even though it was a busy Saturday night, we never waited too long or felt rushed. Great pizza, great service, and close to home... I couldn't ask for more!",0,1,1

Chef Jean George Vongerichten has quite a few restos under his wings, this spot was just another addition to this 3 Michelin Stars chef. Under manage of executive chef Robert Moore, a former chef at Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio.

Great modern menu with many extraordinary side dishes. A menu which features meats from as far east as Japan, & South America which famous for anything but MEAT!  His dishes use a wide range from homemade steak sauces, spices with a lot of aroma, mustards to rubs, and flavored salts from around the world.

- Grilled Foie Gras Terrine was fabulous, so generous portion, excellent for starter.

One of my friends is allergic to shrimp and mentioned how they missed the taste of shrimp. Buddha's vegetarian came to mind. If you've ever ordered the deep fried salt and pepper shrimp here, you know what I'm talking about. How does something that's not even made from shrimp taste so much like shrimp?! Some sort of Chinese vegetarian magic, that's how. I usually order that dish along with a noodle dish. The beef satay rice noodles are good here too, but this time my friend and I ordered the buddha's crispy chow mein. I wish there were more soft parts to the chow mein - since it was crispy throughout,  but regardless the dish was delicious and loaded with vegetables!

Always makes you feel like they are happy to see you 
Mitch the manager is great.  He greets me Everytime he sees me.  The trainers are the best.  My trainer is Emily and I love her.  She is also great at stretching me out during my training and I can tell it has helped my flexibility 
Doc is also so helpful with nutrition advice and has helped me drop 6 pounds since I have been following his advice.  Since joining I have lost weight and gained strength.      I feel like I have a team helping me.   I can also run 2 miles nonstop.

0,"Great spot outside the strip. Huge selection of pizza (among other things, but come here for the pizza!) options. I was lucky to come here with a large group so we ordered a wide array of pizzas for everyone to share. Every single one of them was reeeeally really good. I'm not sure if mouth watering is a way to describe pizza, but it works for me here. 

I recommend the margarita, Romana I & II, and most importantly the Frank Nitti. Pieces are split small and perfect for sharing and trying a few.

0,"We love this hotel. The rooms are clean and modern. The bathrooms could use some work, but for the price it's seriously not a big deal. Absolutely love the location of the hotel as well. You can get a quiet room without the noise of Fremont usually for only $35. Fremont is so nice to walk down during the summer. The overhang provides shade that cannot be found on the strip. Every casino door is wide open so as you walk by you get a blast of A/C as well making it significantly more pleasant to walk down during the hot summers. Casino is a bit small perhaps, but there's much to see and do on Fremont we've never been disappointed. Also love the bingo room! If you're looking for a great spot downtown, you won't be disappointed with this hotel.",0,0,1

4,"We came here for Sunday brunch before heading back to LA. The wait was about 45-50 minutes but it seemed to go fast. 

We were started with some bread, plus butter and blueberry jelly. I really liked the blueberry jelly. Perfect sweetness of the natural blueberry flavor. It was delicious with the bread.

I ordered the corn beef hash with over easy eggs and was able to try the croque madame. The corn beef hash was excellent! I didn't expect the corn beef to be thick diced chunks because I'm so use to the canned corn beef. It was a nice surprise. Cutting up my leaky eggs were a perfect combination with the potatoes making it just soft enough. Not soggy. Great flavors of pepper and a hint of salt. Corn beef had a good coriander taste but not overbearing. Excellent pieces of meat. 

The croque madame was yummy. It was quite filling from one bit. Very generous with the ham. The cheesy sauce drizzled on top put the whole sandwich together. I liked it very much. Bonus, the dish comes with fries. 

Great service.

2,"My wife researched this place for my birthday and did a great job. Their selection of beers was excellent, and the first thing they do when you sit at the bar is furnish a menu of beers with all the prices, sorted by style. They have a ""local 30,"" which changes frequently, but a lot more than 30 local brews -- and even some from true micros like Hop Haus is Verona. Their menus are so up to date they print them twice a week and put stamps on them during each day when the upcoming list fills out or they run out (with a cute ""No beer for you"" stamp).
The bar is very social -- it's long and wraps around tge taps ( but is not blocked by them), so you can see pretty much everyone there. The bartenders were very social, too, especially Jesi, who took care of us like she was hosting us at a party. She would walk by, scanning the area like a lifeguard and then stop and chat whenever we wanted, answering every question thoughtfully, whether it was about the beer, the yummy ""crack fries"" (which she recommended we not have plain), the Packers or her day job. They always had plenty to do but had enough people not to be over busy. 
Wonderful experience overall. Was there good food? Probably. But we didn't care. There were a ton of tables and there's a wait on weekend nights, so I'm sure it was good. But that's not what we came for, nor should it have been.",0,0,1

My friend had the pad Thai with tofu, I thought it was okay, but the compared to the rocking flavor of the curry it really didn't stand a chance.

Our friend finally came, so we went right to the canvases set up (oddly) in the middle of restaurant, where all eyes were on us!
We ordered our first, my last, round of cocktails - two Tokyo Teas and a Mai Tai! 
My first Tokyo Tea and it's similar to a Midori Sour, I do like my sour drinks and this had that punch without it tasting like alcohol!

The pool for families is small, really until it started raining it was over full and people could barely swim at all.  Wish more of the ""21 and over pool"" would open up to the rest of the hotel.

I met the instructor Kenpo and he explained basics and provided tour. 

I'm very active and came to check out class as supplement to current workouts.  I started on row machine for warm, some people chose treadmill.  Afterward it was divided into two groups cardio and strength training.  I prefer strength first so I started there.  Class was motivating and kept you busy, competition aspect kept me motivated.  

Then we switched to Cardio.  It was treadmill (base, push and very fast) I am comfortable with running so my base was 4, push 6 and hitt 9.  At some point one of the other students was actually encouraging me to pace myself because there would be more challenges with incline coming up and (20) mins duration.

Belsito Plumbing just left and I am so pleased. We have had low water pressure in part of our house for a few years now.

Belsito Plumbing did take the time and then proceeded to fix the issue. I was expecting a huge bill for the time even though we did not have anything replaced, just cleaned out, but I was so happy that the cost was so reasonable. The technician could not have been more nice. He was diligent, respectful and hardworking. He went about diagnosing the problem, checked everything, and then settled on the issue. He then told me about what he thought was the issue and then went about and fixed the issue. The water pressure is now wonderful everywhere in the house. I could not be more happy.

I was referred to Dr. Q. by a student at the Southwest school of naturopathic medicine. 

Dr Q has done more for me in a short period of time than other chiropractors have done in years. While many chiropractors focus on your back and neck, Dr. Q takes a whole body approach. If your ankle, knee or hip are out f alignment, it can through the rest of your body out as well.
That was my issue, for years I have worn out the outside corner of my right heal when the rest of the sole of my shoes looked new. I thought it was just the way I walked.

Dr. Q adjusted me the first time and I went and bought new shoes, 6 months later my shoe are evenly worn, my back & neck pain is gon as well as my headaches.

In addition he pointed me to some supplements I needed then told me to go buy them somewhere else because they were less expensive there than what he has to charge for them.

I have referred him to my wife and children and he has helped both of them as well.

He is also a photographer and has several pictures he has taken in his office. He loves to talk about his pictures and rightfully so, they are cool.

2,"Who gets excited about a grocery store?  This chick!  Much anticipated opening day was yesterday. After visiting the one in Greenville, SC a few months ago, I was psyched about having one in CLT.  

By now you all have heard about the hype.  So instead of telling you the same thing all over again, let me give you a Peggy's take on WF:

1. Pay attention.  Some items here are quite affordable, some are very expensive. Purchase with your eyes wide open. Know your prices and you will be good to go. Look for specials, and they offer coupons online.  I got regular vitamin D milk at $2.99 a gallon, not on special.  I got 85/15 $2.99 a lb and that was a special.  And hummus on sale for $0.99 until 9/4! 

2. Don't get too crazy with the hot bar.  At $7.99 a pound, your lunch/dinner can get insanely expensive.  For example, my 3 wings was 0.29lb.  That was almost $2.50 for 3 wings, ouch right?  But I had to do a taste test and the verdict is, good wings!

3. Speaking of wings, they have a $8.99 bucket deal... Now that is a different story.  I haven't tried, but growing up during Tetris era, I think I can stuff some impressive amount of wings in that bucket with zero space wasted.  Challenge accepted. 

4. Tuesday $2 wine (by the glass I assume). Enough said, I will check it out and report back :)  since we are on the topic of their wine bar, the by the glass price rivals other actual wine bars, $5-9 a glass.

5. Bulk area is fabulous. You can try whatever your heart desires without worrying about waste. All kind of rice & grains, fancy salt and seasoning, honey, nuts. 

6. Great produce at reasonable price. One bunch of arugula was $0.99.  

7. Sandwich bar, sushi bar, smoothie bar, coffee bar, salad bowl bar, gelato bar... All made to order with a write on menu available for your custom request. 

8. Mushroom lovers, they have specialty mushrooms.  Granted expensive (hmm... As much as $30 a pound, I mean I didn't think legal mushroom price can go this high lol) but it is available. 

So... Basically I have decided that WF is a destination grocery store... Where you not just shop but linger and browse for much longer than expected. I left the store 40 bucks poorer but it worthy the hours of fun I had.  

Come take a look, definitely deserve a visit!",2,4,1

I called the place to book a reservation and was greeted by a friendly voice. I received a locals discount since we live in Las Vegas which wasn't expected, but a definite plus. On the day of the surprise, I made a mistake of flip flopping appt times for my husband and thought I made the reservation for 1:30pm, when in fact it was suppose to be at 10:30am. I frantically called the business and they were happy to assist me in coming in on the next available time slot which ended up being 12:30pm. I was relieved. 

When we got up to the second floor to get suited up, they provide you with things that you may not have like ear plugs and shoes, not just the suite and helmet. 

There is a cool observatory for people who come with the group, but may not be able to fly. My daughter wasn't ready to experience it yet so we were able to look through the windows and watch. After watching her daddy and brother, she wants to do it. 


Léa was the flight instructor. She was very nice and seemed to have the ability of keeping her students at ease. 

Kaniala was in charge of monitoring the wind for the indoor skydiving session and made it super fun with his big smile and shaka's through the window to remind the students to ""Hang-Loose"" and relax. 

Overall experience was more then satisfactory. I see us becoming regulars at Vegas Indoor Skydiving.",0,3,1

I made an appointment for an hour later. When I returned, I watched the entire tinting process on my truck. Some people are good and what they do. Some take it to the next level and become artists at what they do. This guy is an artist. His work process is extremely organized. There is no doubt when watching that the job will be exceptional.

I am seeing some negative reviews from Cinco de Mayo recently - yes, that was a train wreck. People were not relinquishing their tables for hours after paying (note to the public, even on a normal day, if a restaurant is packed and people are waiting and you paid your bill thirty minutes ago - leave. Seriously. The problematic Cinco de Mayo was largely because of inconsiderate guests in my opinion). Granted, when we finally sat down, the waiter was rather rude when I said we had more people but I suggested that when the people who finished next to us left (ie one of the aforementioned parties who paid their bill and did not leave) then they would come and sit there, but he then told them to take their time to spite me. After that his crass and vulgar service was more for comedic effect but it initially was not appreciated. I imagine it was the busy day that had everyone on edge.

Otherwise, the tacos are great. Good size, and I love their combo of soft and hard, held together with cheese. Yum. You can build your own or go for premade combos. I would recommend trying out the jackfruit as as meat substitute - very similar to pulled pork in texture but with a sweet tanginess that adds dimension to the taco.  

A large variety of margarita flavors is fun for happy hour. I like the prickly pear flavor best.",0,0,1

Unlimited lobster tails? Crab legs? 
Caviar? 
Filet Mignon? 
Colossal shrimp? 
Popover bread? 
Champagne? Mimosas? 

For around $95 plus tip and tax bucks per person, this place was definitely worth a visit. This classy brunch buffet is tucked away in Bally's and yes, the service was totally awesome. Our waiter was friendly, accommodating and personable. Our glasses were never left unfilled - and yeah, I'm talking about the alcohol :)  

Oh and when you walk in, don't expect your traditional Wicked Spoon-style buffet with countless food choices as Sterling Brunch has a limited menu.

Highlights -
Lobster Tails - Super delicious. Like bomb.com good. The tails were so massive, flavorful and juicy. Don't forget to grab the butter :)
Popover bread - Trust me. It's really, really good. Super warm, fluffy and just overall amazing.

Lowlights -
Crab - Meh 
Filet Mignon - Not too flavorful and some pieces were a bit too dry
Ice cream - No one told us about it, which was a bummer

Pro-Tips - 
- Dip the lobster tail in the lobster bisque 
- Get some OJ for those champagne glasses
- Reservation not available online? Call in. 

Overall, this place was definitely a great place to check out. Unfortunately, once was definitely enough for me. For the price tag, I would rather go to Bacchanal Buffet for a cheaper meal with more options. However - if you're a huge lobster fanatic - check out Sterling Brunch. You surely won't be disappointed.",1,5,1

Before the store changed to Kung Fu Chef, it was another Taiwanese restaurant. The decoration doesn't change a lot, but the menu is totally different and the food is even better.

For two time experience, I both ordered clay pot rice:  shrimp sauce pork first and  chicken for second. The waitress said I needed to wait 20 mins for that, but I understood that it supposed to be prepared and cooked that long. Also for that cheap price and delicious favor, I was willing to wait. One great through idea for them was that a small bowl of soup was served with the pot. When I almost finished, I poured the soup into the pot and mixed with the scorched rice sticking in the pot. This is a really really nice and attentive to customers.

We also ordered the chicken wings, goose intestines and fried calamari. All tasted really good. We did have some problems with the fried calamari since they added vinegar but my friends and I didn't like it, so they immediately made us a new dish.
Very kind to guests, truly. For drinks, we didn't put a lot of expectations on it. I liked my almond milk tea, but my friend's coffee milk tea was just soso.

Comfortable wooden chairs and sturdy tables adorn the space and those, along with the vaulted ceiling and colored lights, scream elegance.

2,"A friend of ours from Hong Kong recommended this restaurant as the best in the city to enjoy Chinese style lobster crab and fish at a reasonable price. After reading reviews, we opted to come on a weekday lunchtime so it would be less busy. Good decision, we just sat waiting 10 - 15 minutes. We enjoyed the unlimited Chinese green tea while waiting for the dim sum trays to arrive. 

They tend to use celery in most dishes with vegetables including the shrimp dumplings. Other Asian restaurants we've been to tend to use green onions or chives in the dumplings instead of celery.   

I didn't mind doing it, because we had come at lunchtime, the traditional dim sum time instead of dinnertime, but we needed to call a waitress over to order something other than dim sum. We then needed to give the numbers off the takeout menu so my daughter & I could try the spicy fried lobster I had read so much about, & so hubby could have his 2 faves, hot and sour soup--the small will easily fill 4 - 6 cups servings-- and chicken and cashews, so piping hot and you can taste the fresh ginger.

Upon entering this unassuming corner store you are blasted with the heat from all of their spits spinning their meaty deliciousness.

The lady at the checkout, who I suspect might be a co- owner, was absolutely delightful and would be a reason to return even if the food was simply mediocre - but it wasn't. How she could call the behemoth that she handed me a ""small"" is beyond comprehension.

I ordered ""the works"" and boy did it work. The chicken was moist and spiced to perfection. They were very generous with the meat portion so it was present in abundance in every bite.

While walking my dogs one evening I saw their truck in my neighborhood and decided to give them a call. Kim was so nice! We did everything via text (which makes things so easy nowadays) and she was at my house grooming my 12yr old toy poodle within a couple of days. Biggie (my poodle) hadn't been groomed in a while so he had some matting. When I usually take him to one of the big box groomers they always have to shave him all the way down when he gets matted like that. Kim made him look and feel like a brand new dog.

14,"So, I had been here before, for all of about 10 minutes and wasn't able to sample any food or beverage. On Thursday last week I was able to get the full experience. 

I was taken here on a date. That's right, someone took ME here. That was a nice change of pace. We got there around 8 on a Thursday night and the place wasn't too busy. we sat inside right next to the roll up doors. The place used to be a firehouse. So there was perfect weather. We started the meal with drinks. She ordered a bottle of Sauv White. I finally got to try an Argentinian Malbec, full bodied(well that is what the waiter told me). The malbec was very good. I tried some of the Sauv, it was very tasty also. I usually don't like whites, but it wasn't too dry. We shared a small bowl of marinated olives. Kalamata and Green olives, very good. I ate most of it. For the main course I had the Salami & Manchego panini with pesto. OMG!!! This thing was awesome! Very toasty and buttery. I had half of it with a salad. The salad was simple greens with flaky tuna. Now, this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me, knows I hate this with every ounce of my being. With that being said, the salad was excellent. The tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness. It had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it. I was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate. For dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle. It had a very large, ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream. If you like chocolate, get this and you won't be disappointed. 

We finished up the food and headed to the patio. The patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating. This would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night. I have always wanted to try mate,pronounced Maw-tay (thanks Z), a traditional South American tea. It was very good, but on first taste reminded me of a cigar. Ask them for honey and put it in. Very good. They bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling. I highly recommend it. 

This is a little gem in the heart of Sunnyslope. Great patio, very warm interior, great service, and great food. The food menu is small, but I bet everything is done to perfection. Large, interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there.  I love when little local places blow me away.",5,10,1

The one issue that I've seen has to do with catering.  My friend and his fiancee tried to use them for their wedding.  The owner had told them it would be a week for the estimate.  After two months, they hadn't heard anything.  So I would be cautious on that aspect.

However, after a few months of remodeling, there's no longer an immediate view of the kitchen as you walk in--I'm not tripping over a fan that's inexplicably on full force in the dead of winter, there's no uncomfortable neon green wall greeting me next to the cashier, and I don't feel uncomfortable choosing between the two booths and one table inconveniently placed (not literally) on top of each other.

We got the mixed option as we liked both floss haha. 

The pork floss was very soft, and the chicken floss is a bit crunchier if you like that texture. The baos were very soft, and very creamy inside. Although they are pretty fatty, this is definitely a good treat to reward yourself ;)",0,1,1

Conner, our server, was speedy and personable! Definitely a good vibe if you're looking for a chill island-type burger joint.",0,1,1

1,"BY FAR the most flavorful chicken shwarma I have ever tasted and it's bar none. It's marinated chicken breast slices with a distinct Mediterranean seasoning. I opted for rice over the fries and glad I did because it was yellow rice with the brownish-red seasoning sprinkled on the rice and it really accentuated the flavor of the rice. The pita bread comes on top of your plate, the only drawback was that the hummus was subpar but the chicken and rice are so good that this place deserves the 5 stars!",0,0,1

Service was quick and friendly. In our group we had the smelts, daily catch, lobster roll, and Pacific cod. All dishes were very good. No complaints from anyone at the table. A little pricey for lunch perhaps and the room is quite noisy. 
Btw, they do offer a burger for those who prefer to stay on land. I really liked the look of that lobster roll and will try that myself next time.",0,0,1

4,"Another small plates joint.  I love small plates and sharing.  I also love enomatic machines.  They ensure that the wine comes out at the right temperature.  Red wine is always served too warm.  I had the Blue-Eyed Boy Shiraz by Mollydooker and a nice Malbec.  Both were excellent.  Some of the wines are not served in the enomatic machine.  Make sure to order from the enomatic machine.  And ignore the $120 glass of wine.  I don't know what's up with that.  The rest of their wine is reasonably priced.

Our bartender, turned server as the night went on, was also excellent. Very attentive and anticipated our needs. We tried the bacon wrapped dates, mushroom grits, and the prosciutto flatbread.  I could have lived without the bacon-wrapped dates... too large and mushy. you have to cut them in half to eat them. The blue cheese fondue the dates came with didn't have much flavor to it.  I like Firefly's bacon-wrapped dates better with the almond in the middle for some crunch.  I think our bartender did too, because he asked if we'd tried Firefly's.  The mushroom grits were to die for... so tasty with the truffle oil.  I adore grits.  And the prosciutto flatbread was also very, very good.  Lots of prosciutto with arugula made for a nice balance of flavors.  The flatbread is huge compared to the other dishes, so beware.

The desserts were ok. There was a toasted poundcake with strawberry and sour cream ice cream that sounded great but turned out to be underwhelming.  The poundcake just tasted stale and the sour cream ice cream just tasted like vanilla.  We also tried the beignets which were just beignets.  Nothing to write home about.

I like the ambience, but I would suggest sitting farther away from the door.  Maybe at the bar in the back or at a table.  At one point, these kids coming from the pool in swimsuits decided to play in the revolving glass door... and the hostess and their mom let them.  In about 1 minute, one of the kids got slammed in the door by the other kids.  Screaming ensued. The mom couldn't figure out how to get the kid out of the revolving door for a while.  So annoying.  I think the hostess should have put a stop to that before it happened.  It was pretty predictable.

Later in the evening some drunk guys in t-shirts and shorts came in, falling all over the place and asking for Coors Light.  Charming.  Just get a table in the back if you are looking for ambiance that does not involve the regular Las Vegas tourist. 

It's a cute spot that has potential.",4,5,1

They have some trivia cards on each table which was entertaining while you wait for food.",1,0,1

1,"I searched for a restaurant for my friends bachelorette party that was unique, that could be ""fancy"", and that was affordable for all of the girls. The Oak Barrel was the perfect place! It was located about 10 minutes from the house we rented for the weekend and it was very easy to find. There was adequate parking for the restaurant and the rustic features drew us right in the door. 

We were seated at a long, rectangular table right in front of a fireplace that had additional seating for other guests at the opposite end of where we were seated. A unique concept but one that is becoming more and more popular. We started off with drinks and because they were so busy, it took quite awhile to receive them; however, we were not in a rush and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. The menu contained a variety of items that I wanted to try and it was difficult to narrow it down to one! Just by reading the menu, it was obvious that this restaurant focuses on fresh, natural foods that are of high quality. I decided on The Clubhouse which contained a variety of meats and cheeses with a side of chips and homemade pickles. My sandwich was delicious, chips were average, and the girls reported that the pickles were fabulous! Everyone else's dishes looked divine and we all agreed that the restaurant was a wonderful choice! Prices are on the higher side but the quality of food lives up to them. 

The only downfall I have to report is that several weeks before the bachelorette party, I called and asked if I could make reservations because I had a group of 10 people. I was told that, if I call the week before, I could reserve the table. So, I did as directed and the next person I reached said that if I call about a half hour before we want to be there, we can have a table reserved. Again, as directed, I did just that. This time I was told that they do not take reservations unless the group is much larger than 10. After explaining what I was previously told, she took my name but did not guarantee a table would be waiting for us. When we showed up, a table was ready and waiting. I would suggest that the staff is educated on what the restaurant's policy is: reservations - yes or no? To this day, I am uncertain. 

The rustic decor, inviting atmosphere, and fresh food will definitely serve as reasons for me to return to this restaurant if I am ever in the area again. Give it a try!",1,1,1

You know there is something great going on there when the managers and many employees have been there for years (great retention). The manager is always busy stocking, dusting, organizing yet greats everyone with a smile. Free cookies for the kids, and stickers at checkout. I am a fan as it is not crowded, lines are fast, and they do not clutter the isles with displays or make them too small. I also enjoy the bakery or floral department, they have SAVED me multiple times in a bind.

Thank you, Omar for correcting my previous impression. 

Is Niro's under new ownership? I tried to reach out to them via their website but received no answer. I've been eating there for years. Last week I walked into a beautifully remodeled restaurant and an enhanced menu. I placed my usual order to-go and headed out. When I got home to enjoy my order, to say I was disappointed would be a misrepresentation of my total and utmost dismay of what they placed in my dinner container. In all my years coming to Niro's, I have NEVER had a bad gyro until now. I purchased a gyro along with an order of extra meat. Both items contained a mixture of fresh meat combined with dry, burned and clearly inedible meat. I attempted to reach out to them prior to posting this review. No response.",0,0,1

The seafood tower starter was a hit as well as the sticky toffee pudding which was way better than one we had at another restaurant.  Our favorite sides were mashed potatoes, asparagus and okra.

The wine list was very good and we enjoyed the Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and Sea Smoke 10 Pinot Noir.  Best Pinot I ever had were 2 comments.

We were going to be sat at this small room in the back with about 4 tables or so.. but when its full of people there isn't much privacy to dine so we opted for the bar area which was pretty empty. The place also has private rooms... tables that is separated with walls.. looks quite interesting.. would be good for a private party or a bunch of close friends to dine with.
The waiter we got was attentive and friendly as well as the others that delivered the food. The atmosphere at the bar was chill.. We even ordered drinks that was on special or happy hour. The beer cocktail I got was rather on the sweet side so wasn't too enthusiastic about it. 
So lets talk about the food we ordered.. the best dishes we got were the salmon carpaccio and the yellowtail jalapeño!! yum!! So pretty and tastes amazing! We also ordered the ika geso kushi age, salmon rice ball, ika butter, hanetsuki gyoza, grilled shishamo, a bunch of different skewers variety and a sushi roll.. but don't exactly remember the name.

The price of the food is very competitive to restaurants that are similar but Donburi edges out because they have great portion sizes.

My favourite menu items are the gyuudon, katsudon, and karrage. It's always a rotation between those three and always amazing. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming and the staff is great. I love the events/promotions that happen, including their sensei program to earn free rice bowls.

Laid back, low key kinda place and decent food. Not too busy when the roomie and I were there but the to-go orders were rockin' ! 

Last time i was here, went with a buddy that didn't want to venture beyond the beef jerky and the pad thai - bummer ! This trip, went with the Cindy Special ( has this tasty sauce - i think she called it rainbow - somethin' like that ) it's an omelet with greens and a side of noodles - i love the combination of the lemongrass, cilantro, lime, Thai basil etc, though i felt a little too much sugar / sweetness ( in most of the dishes ) 

Had a Tom Yum soup - great spice ( we went with ""3-chili"" level spice on everything ) 

We were given a free app of dumplings - OK, a little on the greasy side. The dry noodles were perfect ( it helped that the roomier scooped out the sugar that was in the pile - you basically mix it yourself )

There was little or no wait to order at the walk-up counter and there was plenty of available seating at the counter overlooking Lardo's kitchen as well as around the food hall.

I had the Korean Pork Shoulder sandwich ($14).  I received a good-sized portion of juicy, flavorful pork shoulder on ciabatta bread topped with kimchi, chili mayo, and cilantro.  It hit all of the savory, spicy, salty, sour, and herbaceous notes in every bite.  I loved this sandwich!  Not to be outdone, the Dirty Fries ($7) topped with pork scraps, marinated banana peppers, rosemary, and parmesan cheese lived up to its name.  The potatoes were perfectly fried, crispy, and not greasy other than what came off of pork scraps.  I probably shortened my life expectancy by a couple of years eating them, but it was worth it.  Seriously, with a name like Lardo serving dishes like Dirty Fries, you really shouldn't expect healthy heart food.

2,"My first car was a piece of crap.  A 1988 Ford Festiva to be exact.  But I was able to keep it running thanks to one of the best and most honest mechanics I have ever met.  I often would drive in thinking something major was wrong with my car, and this guy would find some simple repair that he often didn't charge me for.  He was thorough, speedy, and most importantly honest.  

I've lived in several cities since then.  Each time I moved I made it a point to ask friends and coworkers for recommendations on where to take my car to get fixed.  So many places will take what you think is a major repair and make it just that.  They'll charge you $800 for what probably was a $100 repair.  At least that's the fear, right?

I couldn't be happier that I found that honest repair shop in Dimaggio's.  I worked at a place helping manage their vehicle fleet, and they were all serviced at Dimaggio's.  So I got to know the staff there and started bringing my own personal vehicle there too.  In one conversation I had with Tom about a goofed up repair my wife had done at Jiffy Lube, he said ""I pay my guys a lot more than them for a reason.""  And it shows.  The mechanics are honest, thorough, and will fix your vehicle in a very timely manner.  Just like with my first car, issues I thought were major problems turn out to be simple and cheap repairs.  In one instance, they didn't charge me.  

I think it's funny that each time I drop my car off I have to double or triple park it because there is literally no space in their parking lot.  Just for fun, check each time you're there:  You'll notice a different Charter Communications vehicle there every time.

4,"This place is mouthwatering! Usually vegan bakery items don't taste as well as regular bakery items, but Vegan Bites is an exception. I came to Vegan Bites because I was going to a dinner and one of my friends is completely allergic to dairy. I decided to give this vegan bakery a shot and I wasn't disappointed. 

Recommendation: Buy the coupon which is $15 for $25 worth of items. 

With the coupon, I was able to buy a dozen of truffles and 8 of the mini cupcakes. All of the items were decorated so beautifully, especially the cupcakes! They had many bakery items from cake pops to baklava. Vegan Bites is very accommodating, not only do they have vegan items but they also have a large range of gluten free items! 

Truffles: 5/5 
I got a dozen truffles for $11.99 and I got a various combination of Coconut, Cacao, and Oreo. Each truffle is made with coconut oil and other natural ingredients, but it still manages to taste like a normal truffle. My favorite was the Oreo! You can taste a little bit of the coconut oil, but it's still delicious!

Cookies: 3/5
Although the cookies looked delicious and were only $1, I didn't really care for the taste. They were okay, but I've definitely tasted better vegan cookies. 

Cupcakes: N/A
I did buy the mini cupcakes the dinner I was going to, but I didn't get to try any. The cupcakes were $11.99 for 8 mini cupcakes and they were meticulously decorated. They have many flavors including red velvet, carrot cake, cinnamon, chocolate, and vanilla.

0,"Okay, normally I wouldn't have much to say about a repair facility, but Valerie, and the folks at Autonation Collision exceeded my expectations.  About 7 months ago I had my daughter's car in for repairs after a minor collision. In the collision, the a/c that I had recently replaced, became damaged in the impact, so I made sure they were aware, and corrected the issue. Several months later when having issues with the a/c, I took it to the facility that initially fixed the a/c. Come to find out, that when Autonation did the repairs, the a/c was not fixed correctly (no lubricant in the compressor), this then cost me over $800 to fix. When I told Autonation about my issue, rather than deflecting, they said give us the invoice and we'll take care of it. One week later I had a check for the full amount. No hassle, no brain damage. I'm impressed.

Parking is plentiful, and on our visits it was never very crowded.  There's usually a Groupon available too if you're lucky.  We frequent another Middle Eastern restaurant in the area- so that is what I compare this restaurant to.

When you walk in, straight ahead there is the counter to order at, and to the right is the seating area.  To the left is a grocery area, with Middle Eastern groceries.  You order at the counter, and then the food is brought out to you.  Employees do check on you to see how you are doing.

I preferred the ""other"" Middle Eastern restaurant in the area in comparison.  The rice flavor was not as good in my opinion, and neither was the chicken flavor.  The hummus was also not as great....but maybe I'm just used to the other!

Props to the owner- he was super friendly and did give us a free baklava for stopping in!  We may come back if we are in the area.",1,0,1

Suzuya, always a delight! 
I've tried a few of their desserts already, and as I write this review, I'm munching on their tiramisu I had to take home. Very delectable! 
Their crepes were delicious and that green tea cake was fluffy and my taste buds were happy. 
The mont blanc was also my favorite. Soft and creamy! 

There's one thing I've been hoping to try one day and that's the mango crepe cake. It's seasonal too.... Once they run out of desserts, they RUN OUT. So take note of that. 

Went yesterday in hopes of hanging out with a friend there, but no wifi and we needed it. It's small, not a lot of seating and they run out of desserts quick. Boo. 

But hey, get here early and try to get everything fresh! There's a lot of desserts to choose from.",4,6,1

From the moment we walked into the restaurant they did nothing but impress. They knew my name and who I was as soon as we walked in. Greeted me and took us to our beautifully set candle lit table. The intimate, gorgeous, flower-filled restaurant illuminated alluring lighting. The manager was a master of his craft. He was an absolute pleasure. He knew everything on the menu and off the menu. We started off with the bread, olive oil, with a little balsamic, la caprese. The tomato was so fresh and the tomato and the mozzarella were perfectly sliced. The wine we ordered was a Malbec. Hands down the best wine I've ever had. We were going to order a salad but they bring you a delicious salad before you receive your meal. I was unsure about what to choose for my entree because everything looked so great. I thought I would keep it simple with spaghetti and meatballs with angel hair pasta. I should have known by now, nothing is simple with this place. It was the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had! After the meal, they brought us these small drinks. I'm not sure what they were but they had a hint of mint, and honey. Very delicious. We will definitely be back.",0,1,1

I walked out with a Salsa Journeyman, which I love, and a bunch of gear for communiting. Dan and Cam were really helpful and honest, didn't try to upsell me on anything, and most importantly, weren't judgey that I was clueless about bikes other than riding them.

Second the snack area is just awesome, no other theater I've been to has a Starbucks coffee, hand scooped ice cream, and a cafeteria style check out. 

I went here today on a semi-date with my husband. (While we were here together and at the same time, we were in different theaters, watching different movies.) Buying tickets I saw the best thing ever. A movie style poster stating that kids under six will not be permitted to go into rated R movies after 6PM.

My estate sale was in October of 2018 it was on the 12th and 13th. My estate sale went very well from start to finish. I was very pleased with everyone involved. Jason's wife Chelsea his father Jim and Jan we're all very dedicated and work so hard. They had smiles and happy doing my estate sale. They staged my home very effectively and everything was organized, so that when the sale was ready to start, at 8:00 am the buyers were able to see what was for sale. Items were priced very fairly! I was pleasantly surprised how the estate sale went from start to finish and very happy with all that was sold. And I received my check in a timely matter.

I have had most of the classic cocktails on the list and wasn't in the mood for most of them. Since they had an extensive list of classics on the menu I asked  for a classic ( actually I gave them two options). One they had clearly never heard of. When they said they were familiar with the other drink ( a Martinez) I figured that should be a safe bet (until I watched him pull up the drink on his phone). The drink was okay it was too sweet and over mixed ( i could taste the water). They were kind enough to offer me another drink but it took 15 plus minutes for the server to come back around. I literally was about to just leave and forget having a drink all together. I ordered the Blood and Sand. A solid classic cocktail. This was a barrel aged cocktail. Why they didn't age the spirits and put orange juice in at the end is beyond me but the don't. They make some orange foam. The moral of this store is the drink was totally unbalanced and I really didn't care for it one bit. So drink #1 was meh and they were kind enough to take it back (which took so long I practically left) and drink #2 was worse than drink number one. Note to self if I want a great cocktail go drink off the strip. Its too bad the bar manager wasn't in as it seems he might actually know his cocktails.,0,0,-1

Once it was time for my appointment in shop I was greeted by a friendly and welcoming front desk receptionist. The office was very nice and clean. They offered free WiFi, water and coffee. The wait was that long since it was a small chip repair or so I thought. The technician came in and notified the receptionist of a problem that went on during my repair. Then the receptionist called me in to let me know the the chip repair had failed. She said that it that due to the location of the chip repair that the technician can only ""hope for the best that the repair works"". My chip went from a very small chip barley noticeable to a possibly going into my sight of view. I was quoted a new windshield at a little over $300. I am more upset at the fact that the technician did not have the common courtesy to explain what the possible outcome could be before moving forward with the repair. I unfortunately did not schedule a windshield repair due to time and travel plans. I will be calling into other auto glass repairs as well to see if it's even worth repairing at there site. I had high hopes of this auto glass center given its great reviews and great location unfortunately I did not experience the same.

1,"We initially ordered masala dosai, medhu vada and idly. The sambhar in these dishes was ok; chutney was good. Medhu vada and dosai came out really well but idly was not liked by my partner. My partner and I are Indian and she felt she could make much better ones with lot less rawa than that was used in udupi's idly. Here came the bad part midway through our dinner-- seems their coffee filter machine was broken the time we visited them. But that did not stop the waiter / manager-looking guy with a beard from taking the second leg of our order for a mysore ""filter"" coffee ( as advertised). Well, right after that I had the need to confirm if they were gonna give me a coffee in traditional mysore/south karnataka style. Halfway through my enquiry, the same guy interrupts me rather rudely (his exactly reply in the form of a question was ""what do you mean by traditional?""), later explaining that the filter coffee  cant be made in traditional  style cause their coffee filter machine was broken and hey! he was not sorry about it. Not sorry for almost selling me a different product than i asked for and not sorry for interrupting me! I am not sure if he thought I was making a very special accommodation request when i ordered something from the menu. If he thought so, he would be very wrong about it. Consequently, he lost the business he could have had with us for the rest of the evening. We were going to order much more before this guy spoilt our dinner atmosphere-- our bill could have easily been double and we would have also left the place with twice the satisfaction (and twice the number of stars for them).

Not all service was bad-- there was a girl who waited on us properly and took our initial orders of masala dosai, idly and medhu vada. We left a reasonable tip and we dearly hope all of it reaches the girl.",1,1,-1

Thirty minutes went by and the second therapist brought me into her room and proceeded to tell me that she had the flu and if I got a massage from her, because of the close contact, I may contract it. I told her absolutely not and that I would pass on the flu and her massage. After being there for an hour and explaining all of this to the front office staff I got a ""do you want to reschedule?""

While we've gone here before and experienced broken drink glasses and extremely slow responses, tonight was the last straw. The hostess greeted us and we requested a booth. The restaurant was maybe 30% full, plenty of open booths, but she did not offer to seat us there. I assumed they didn't want to use certain sections. Keep in mind, the place was 70% empty. She didn't offer a drink of water or to look at a menu while we waited. No one working there did.  Other employees, another server and a bartender,  walked by where we were waiting. They actually seemed annoyed by our request.  It just seems like with all the competition for restaurants in Vegas,  somebody there would want to take our money. Or at least be happy someone walked in on a slow midweek evening.  

This was the last thing we needed after the broken glass incident. We thought ""Let's give them one more chance. "" So while tonight wasn't the worst ever,  it pissed us off more because the attitudes were so bad.",0,0,-1

We arrived around 1200 so we expected a slight wait which would be normal. Well we ended up watching 2 groups of people, with the same number in their party as us, get seated before us. 

After we got seated we waited about 15 minutes for our server to come over. She seemed bothered by simple menu questions we had about the special items. Then wanted to rush us into ordering and we had yet to be asked what we would like to drink. We then asked for a Diet Pepsi and a Mountain Dew. Well she retuned with 2 Pepsis and we kindly asked for what we ordered and she seem disturbed by this. She brings us the drinks and then vanishes to other tables and stops servicing our table. We sit with empty glasses and no service. After a few minutes a different server tops off our drinks and then my food comes out 10 minutes before my wife's. So my food is getting cold. Finally my wife's French toast comes out (I guess that's a difficult dish to make). So nobody checks on us to see how we like the food. We got just 1 refill.

11,"Called this franchise to schedule a move-in clean for a new home we'd just purchased.  The house was clean, but had been vacant for a while so there was a layer of dust everywhere.  We were moving in from out of state, and wouldn't get a chance to come clean the house before we got to the new one.

The top-to-bottom move-in cleaning services sounded really excellent over the phone- light fixtures, blinds, baseboards, inside and outside cabinets and drawers, bathrooms, and floors.  In short, exactly what I needed.  When we got home and got a chance to inspect the cleaning, only the bathrooms had been cleaned.  And by cleaned, I mean the bathroom counters had been wiped down (with large missing spots), the toilets scrubbed, and the towels refolded.  That's all that was done during a two hour clean of a completely vacant home. 

I called the main customer service line to leave a complaint (it was the weekend) and I got a call back from a franchise representative that Monday.  I'm beyond incensed thinking about that phone call, where I had to argue for over 15 minutes that no, my house really wasn't cleaned, and yes I was sure.  My husband finally took the phone from me and asked to speak to a manager, finally getting us a re-clean scheduled.

I have no issue with the ladies who came into do the re-clean, because they worked hard.  Slowly, but hard.  It took two ladies the entire two hours to clean my kitchen, and the kitchen was completely empty.  The kitchen wasn't even truly dirty in the first place, it just had that layer of vacant house dust all around.  The team's time was up, and they had to leave.

After getting absolutely nowhere with a second phone call to the manager, my husband finally called corporate.  Corporate told my husband they could do nothing for him, as the franchise owner would be ""losing money"" if he were to send a team out a third time to do the cleaning that we hired them for.  Well guys, I lost money hiring y'all for a job that ultimately got 1/4 completed.

I'm a disabled veteran and I seriously needed the help with this initial cleaning of my new home.  Now I'm a significant chunk of change poorer, and my house is still dirty (as I can clean on my own, but only a little bit at a time).  I'm very disappointed, as I'd used this franchise in the past (when I was stationed in North Carolina) and received excellent customer service.

We were not ready for alcohol yet since we were going to eat.  We ordered two waters and a coke.  He seemed annoyed that we didn't order drinks.  He asked if we were going to get food and we said yes.  At that point he brought menus.  We looked over the menus and waited for our drinks.  He quickly came over and brought the drinks and hurried away without asking if we were ready to order (which we were).  A conservative estimate is that we waited 10 minutes... maybe even 15 minutes and he never came back.  I asked another server if we could order food.  He then went and go our server.  When he came back he was confused that we wanted food even though we told him we wanted food and he brought us menus.  Two of us wanted the hangover burger that was listed on the menu.  He was quite rude and told us that was on the brunch menu and we could not have it.  (The menu is really hard to read so you don't really know what you are ordering.) After he told us that then my friend asked if we could have that burger made just buy using the ""build your own burger"" part of the menu.  Everything that is offered on that brunch menu burger is available on the build your own burger menu so it seemed like a pretty easy request.  He was just not understanding.  I told him once I just wanted was offered on the hangover burger.  My friend told him the same thing.  He was so incredibly rude and snapped at my friend and said, ""You are being incredibly difficult!""  My friend said, ""No we are not, we are just ordering what is on your menu.""  At that point I told him we no longer wanted food and I paid for my coke and we left.  I won't be back.  This was unacceptable service and there are lots of other options for food and drinks in the area.  It was a real shame because the place looked really nice and it looks like it could have been a cool place to go.  My other observation was the size of the menu for such a small place.

Speaking with them on the phone initially was pleasant, so we scheduled a visit and actually came in a couple times, first time being just my husband, second time being the both of us. We were impressed and happy with the location so it seemed like a win. 

When we were ready to register, we were told that there would be registration fee that needed to be paid along with the registration forms that we would need to submit. At the time, we were told there were two openings that would be available, so we went home to consider our options, then called back the next day to inform them that we would like to fill up one of those positions....well that next day, two openings ended up being one opening, but we were told by Andrea that we just had to bring in a check along with the forms for that position. When I called the next day to make sure that they would still be open by the time I was able to make it there after work, I was told by another staff member, Candace, that they hadn't even had any openings for the infant room for weeks. 

Several weeks later, after we'd already decided that the disorganization of the center wasn't what we were looking for, we received an email from the Director of Customer experience, Heather, asking if we were ready to schedule our tour....

I had a huge problem with this and asked if I could have the number to complain to the owner and she rudely said ""you can look up the number on our website on your own"". She not only butted us in line, but butted every other person in line including another couple who did not even get the chance to sit down because the restaurant closes at 2:30 and this employee took their spot in line. I am so disgusted with the customer service and the unfair treatment in this matter. You should be seated regardless of whether you are an employee or a customer, based on the time you write your name down on the list. If I could give her zero stars I would.

I did a DE filter clean out and did a chlorine bath on my pool with another company and hired Gilbert Pool Service to do the monthly maintenance. My pool looked great but it was short lived. I was extremely frustrated that the pool guy was not able to maintain the proper chemicals and my algae came back after a couple of weeks! And they said they weren't responsible for the algae, really?:/ 

Out of sheer laziness or stupidity the pool guy told me he did not know how to re-install my skimmer basket handle after he took it off and I had to re-install myself. 

The pool was not properly scrubbed on a consistent basis and there was for the most part a ring of dirt and algae around the pool edge. I could go on and on....

My agreement was for 80.95 per month for service and chemicals. In June they charged my card $128 and in July $122!!! They did not notify me or get my approval for the 'extra services' they supposedly performed. And they charged me extra for the DE. Is that not part of the chemicals that I'm already paying for? I disputed the charges with my bank and was able to get the funds back! 

They make you sign a 3 month service agreement and if you cancel, you will still be charged monthly until the 3 months are up.

I also noticed additional  markdowns for apparently needing to somehow  recondition. I noticed both details and call the store and have no luck speaking to anyone successfully.

After all, imho it had a large shoes to fill because of the prior tenant O Face Donuts.
Sure, O face is now gone and one should not compare a defunct business to the next. But I cannot help it and I feel if you take the time to read what I mean, you may just end up agreeing.
There is only one single difference between the two shops yet the difference is such a critical element. Creative originality.
The Donut bar attempts to dazzle you with concoctions that are really just kids play.
The creme brulee is creative in thought yet executed with no afterthought.
Yea, the sugar is cool however only after one bite. 
Attempting to get through the constant crunch soon became annoying. 
I found myself trying to taste the center cream however once the sugar coating finally dissolved and my taste buds came to I found it to be just commercial custard filling.
Very disappointing.
The maple...
O face had was one step ahead of everyone on this. 
When you go to a donut shop,no matter what part of the U.S. you go, you know what a maple bar taste like. It doesn't change and when you have one, you have had them all.
O face however took the time to develop their own maple glaze which complemented the bacon. Donut bar..the same usual maple.
The oreo cookie
Jeez...how much sugar can you give?
People, this is a regular glazed stuffed with an oreo cookie. 
mmmm Lard

O face made donuts that were not only creative but containing other unique flavors.
Mexican chocolate with horchata creme...yea, their own homemade horchata,not a tub filled with flavored gelatin goo 

Apple fritter.
Dark. Happen to notice this to as the tray containing the fritters all looked the same,over done.
To their credit, the inside was not overdone and actually the best of the group of donuts I had.


In a nutshell, this is no O Face and probably never will be. I suppose this means I need to find something more on the level of my expectations. Which leads me to a final thought.

4,"At first I didnt want to write a review...but then thought otherwise because with the thought of someone else going through what we did would be horrible. I will say that the DJ, the caterer and the photographers were VERY PROFESSIONAL and FRIENDLY. I had a problem with communicating with the provided florist. She took weeks to respond to emails and calls. The communication was very horrible. I had to pay for things that the venue was to provide like things that I wanted for the centerpieces. The venue nor the florist had what I needed so I went out to Michaels and bought everything myself. I gave her exactly the idea that I wanted with pictures included of samples. And she still was lost somehow and not knowing what was going on. With that being said I still received from her forceful suggestions. She called me the day before the wedding begging me to rent a arch when I had already communicated with her that I did not want or need an arch. She even offered to just accept any form of payment no matter how little for her to leave the arch up from another wedding that was previously done. I felt very pressured and irritated.  That was very frustrating. 
I started out with Lisa and was very swept into having my wedding at this location. I was very excited but then when it was time to give the deposit I was met by Regina. Regina seem that she didn't know what was going on because of dealing with Lisa guest or customer. Which was fine because I thought that everything was still be handled the same way. And that time prices changed how things were dealt with changed and I should have take heave and what my husband said and not have done my wedding here at all. 
The last meeting we met with Regina we were to pay for a 75 guest wedding. In which I told Regina there may or may not be that amount of guests and she reassured me that for however many guess we were over we would get our money back for that difference. We had a balance which I will admit of $600 for a 100 guest count wedding. The day of the wedding I was very overwhelmed already because of mishaps with makeup which I know is it the venue's issues. I had emailed Regina the day before and told her that my husband was skeptical of paying the last payment being that we knew for a fact there wouldn't be a hundred guests. I did not get a response to that email but previously got responses to every other email in communicating. The day of the wedding I did not receive a call from Regina or communication from Regina. I assured her in the previous email that I sent her that we would be paying that last balance either during the reception or after the reception. We knew that we would have family coming in and can always get the money from them.  Once again my husband was still skeptical and felt played  because when asking Regina how many guests we had  she didn't even know how many guests were there.  They do not do a guest count. Once I got to the venue I was met by Regina and the first thing that came out of her mouth was about the payment. I gave my husband a call to let him know what was going on. I was very frustrated and thought that Regina would have my best interest interest as a bride and care about my day of the wedding. At that time Regina stopped all the vendors from providing the services because of this $600 difference in balance. She shut down the bar and turned it into a cash bar she told the photographers not to take any pictures and she told the caterer not to serve any food. We had already paid thousands of dollars why does she have to stop certain vendors from doing their job? I was very upset and overwhelmed and thought that she had my best interest at heart but it was all about the money for this place. My concern was to have a stress less day of me getting married to my husband. I understand business is business but you have to understand communication wise and getting things in order and making your guests and your clients feel appreciated like you will do what you can for them. You also have to take in consideration of being professional pulling your clients to the side discussing with them making an arrangement and holding that. She argue with my husband when he had questions at our meetings and the day of the wedding she was very defensive. we had a contract and she let us pay when we can and then all of a sudden day of she wants to be very aggressive. I've never went through anything like this in my lifetime. She didn't care about us enjoying our time or even pulling us a side for the payment she did it in front of guests and really got my husband aggravated and myself aggravated as well. After we were married Regina received the payment from my sister-in-law as we have planned. But it still felt as though she really wasn't putting any effort into making us happy. After that I felt rushed and I just didn't enjoy being there I just wanted to get it over with.",1,0,-1

Until this morning, Cruise America (also known as CruiseCanada) had a promotion for free one-way rentals from Vancouver to Toronto. The customer service rep in charge of the promotion left me a voicemail message yesterday afternoon: ""The RV is held for you overnight, I'm leaving in 20 minutes but you can pay the $300 reservation fee tomorrow."" Fine.

I called her this morning, credit card in hand. Sorry, the deal is no longer available. You didn't pay, so no RV for you. But you promised to hold it! Yes, but ""hold"" doesn't mean anything.

I asked to speak to her boss. She refused, then insisted that she doesn't have a boss.
I hung up and called back, asking to speak to a manager. The CSR who answered insisted that she didn't know the office manager's name.

3,"HORRIBLE! Just so everyone knows the deposit they ask for in the beginning is not a deposit. They will run every test on the sheet. If you ask to be informed before proceeding with any test they will not do it. Reception was decent although she was the one giving me all the wrong information at least she was polite. I don't remember the name of the vet who seemed way to happy and content telling me i might have to put my dog down. What kind of person constantly smiles at you when your pet is dying and you are trying to hold it together. After using my deposit of $550 and finding nothing they wanted to proceed with other tests.. one of them included poking needles into in dogs abdomen without any pain meds. They didn't explain this to me without me forcing them to and demanding that they stop any further tests until I felt I had all the information. Being my dog was a 10 year old bulldog mix I didn't believe in subjecting him to anymore pain and even with the best outcome I knew he was nearing the end. The vet kept saying "" Well we believe this is the best course of action but if you don't have the money we will have to put him down because he probably won't survive the night"". She also told me he was going into shock and when I asked how they test for that she said they press their gums to see how fast the blood returns and they go back to pink or red. How performing painful tests on a dog that close to death when you know he's in shock and dying is the best course of action is beyond me. I ended up having to put him to sleep on the floor of that horrible place because it was a Saturday night and I had no other place to go. If this is a last resort like it was for me you have no other choices downtown but expect to pay $550 right from the start just to diagnose the pet. My final bill was close to $800 just to end up putting my baby to sleep. I had to ask for a blanket to put under his head because when he went in my arms half his body was on the floor and I didn't want to just leave him like that.The whole experience was terrible and the vet still had that creepy grin on her face right up until I left. Its not about the money it's about respect and being able to make choices for your pet after being informed with all the information. This place did not provide me with any of that.",1,0,-1

When we attended my Hubby's annual Christmas party, he had the unfortunate luck of winning a gift card for Brio Tuscan Grill. As soon as they called his name for the prize, my heart just sank into the bottomless pit of despair. Not to mention the hubs signed me up for their rewards program so I get a coupon now every year for my birthday. 

WTF!?!?!? I swear, my hubs hates me. As if it isn't traumatic enough getting 1 year older.

I can't tell you the amount of vitriol I have for Brio Tuscan Grill but that would take way more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp sets out for reviews.

I mean, it's not that the food is absolutely disgusting. It isn't. It's all edible. But that's about it. Considering the exorbitant prices for the level of cuisine, this joint represents all the things that are repellent about dining in the Summerlin area: generic, pricey for what it is, and a hot spot for the geriatric crowd whose taste buds have been ruined by the multitude of meds they take. And don't forget the f*(king patio dining. Like I said, mediocrity at its finest.

If you must come, come for lunch as the prices are a lot better.

Okay, seeing as I have been forced to eat here more times that I care to, I'll let it loose on a few of the many items I have tried.

Lobster bisque ($6.95): too much sherry not enough lobster = pass.

Salads (including Caesar, Grilled Salmon salad) are pretty bad here. Have yet to ever have a salad here without finding some wilted lettuce mixed in. In addition to that, the dressings are all really generic. And what the heck is up with all the cheese they put on everything? What is up with all this gorgonzola? Pass.

Calamari ($10.45/lunch price): First of all, the plating. Have no idea who thought that putting the marinara and cream sauce (neither one which is particularly good), in the same bowl of the fried calamari. This makes all the fried food soggy. Not to mention the deep fried peperoncini represents half of the plate of greasy calamari.

Mezza Chicken under the Brick ($14.85/lunch): The roasted chicken is fine, the marsala sauce is decidedly meh. The plate is very small for the $14.85 price tag. 

Pasta alla vodka ($16.15/lunch): My husband usually gets this. Me, I think it's okay. But given the price and the serving size, it's ridiculous. Pass on this one.

The only dish I have ever really truly liked there and thought that it was worth it was a special they had. It was a truffle oil flatbread with arugula, mushrooms and proscuitto. They had that for about $10.

Given that I would likely pass on nearly everything I tried there, I don't recommend coming here as for the above mentioned reasons. Though edible, their food is expensive for what it's worth. 2.5 starred review bumped down to 2 stars.",2,0,-1

Right?

There were various hairs all around the sink and tub as well. 

We also had a mandatory ""safety check"" that involved security barging in because we had our sign on the door indicating the room was occupied all day.

My female shepherd is old and has hip problems.  She is on pain and arthritis medication. Last time I called for a refill they told me I needed to come in for a checkup again before they would refill it. I took her in and then they told me they would refill it for 30 days, but I needed to do bloodwork for anymore because they needed to check her liver in case the meds were harming it. I told them she's already past her life expectancy and needs the meds regardless of what it's doing to her liver, she would be in too much pain without the meds. They said they wanted to test and see if she needs the more expensive meds that are easier on the liver. I asked if they could just give me those meds and not do the expensive liver tests and they told me that either way they have to do the tests. This would be hundreds more for testing, and my dog is close to the end of her life anyways. They are just trying to squeeze me for every pennie possible. 

Also, I took my male shepherd there a few years ago to be neutered.  The vet told me he had a heart murmur and they needed to do testing on his heart before they could nueter him. Hundreds of dollars later I was told it wasn't safe to nueter him. 

The next time I took him in to get shots, I requested a letter from the vet for the city explaining it was medically unsafe to nueter him.  The vet checked him over again and told me that his heart is fine and they could not find anything wrong with him like the last doctor had said, so they wouldn't write me that letter. They told me it was fine to schedule him to be neutered. I asked why I had to spend hundreds of dollars on testing if he is fine and they couldn't hear a murmur, and their excuse was they weren't sure what the last doctor heard, but he no longer works there. 

Flash forward, I called the vet to schedule him to be neutered and asked what the total would be. They said for everything it would be $111 total, possibly a little more for pain medication.  I scheduled the appointment.  This morning I took him in the first thing the receptionist said was, "" here for blood work and nueter?"". I said I just brought him in to be nuetered and asked what the blood work was for and they told me that since he is over 7, they have to do ""all kinds of blood work"" before they would nueter him. They asked me how old he was when I scheduled the appointment,  so why didn't they say that when I was asking how much it would cost on the phone? So there I was, in the clinic to drop him off and I asked them how much that would cost and they told me ""it's about $130 more"". I asked them what the blood work was for and they told me ""it's just required"". I cancelled my appointment and will never return. 

This clinic is INCOMPETENT and FRAUDULENT!",0,0,-1

The clown house was horrible, only saw maybe 3 actors one of which apologized that it sucked cuz ""they were behind."" We tried to go thru it again later but worker said no even though we told her it was empty in there earlier.  Then the third house had a guard outside of it - my sister was laughing saying (to ME) it looked like a place where ISIS would be hiding and he got mad and started calling her a racist (ISIS is not a race!) and was hurling insults at her it was so ridiculous and RUDE. The corn maze was so boring I thought it was gonna be scary but whatever. None of us vape, however a girl in our group was YELLED at by a worker for vaping when it was a group in front of us (she never apologized for her mistake) and we saw her later VAPING hunched over behind by the rock climbing wall (same area she yelled as us earlier) There were a few nice workers but the majority were rude and I wish I could have my money back cuz i spent $104 to get in and was pretty disappointed because I had people telling me it was worth the money!",0,0,-1
0,"We stayed at the Red Rock for 4 days then moved over here for 3 days, thanks to our friend's time share.  The Wyndham is no Red Rock, but we had a clean and cozy 2 bedroom suite.  The master bathroom was very nice and the pool is decent.  It's not the closest walk to the strip, but doable.  Since we were at the Red Rock first, of course it was disappointing to come over here where everything's not as convenient.  There's not a lot of choices for food, there's no casino, basically you'd just come here to sleep.  Personally, I'd choose convenience over price and luxury over cozy when I'm on vacation.",0,0,-1
1,"So my boyfriend ordered the salmon and really liked it, I ordered the fried shrimp po boy and HATED it. Omg it was nasty, everything that was on my plate was no good. I'm very picky so i tried going with something that I was familiar with... The fried shrimp were barely fried, shouldn't have even called them that and they were VERY rubbery.. On top of that they were massive. I mean the shrimp were huge.. So just imagine taking a bite into a sandwich and eating a half fried giant rubber shrimp. I couldn't even eat it. I moved on to the chips hoping i could eat something on the plate, but no. They were chewy?! Why? Maybe that's how they were suppose to be and I'm just so out of tune with what's going on.. But I didn't eat those either. My boyfriend did however because the small portion of salmon on his plate left him still hungry. You think for $18 you'd be able to get full. Anyways I'm not going back just off that one experience. I think I'll pass. Out was that bad. For the price (expensive) I should have loved everything. Oh yea we also had the cheese curds, once again disappointed. Greasy and no flavor. I love cheese curds and being from Wisconsin I know a good one when I eat it and they definitely weren't up to par.

0,"Worst experience. I went with my boyfriend and his parents and waited about 10 minutes before our server even greeted us.  We waited for over an hour for our food and when we had mentioned how long we were waiting, our server blamed the kitchen, not having food runners, that they were just busy, etc.  The waiter didn't even bring refills when we asked. Finally our waiter brought SOME of our entrees and sarcastically stated he didn't want us to starve.  He said our order was still waiting on an entree that was still being baked. We proceeded to our entrees which were cold and dried out and you could clearly tell that they were just sitting in the window.  As we were explaining to our waiter how all the food was cold and dried out another server brought the baked dish that we were waiting for and obviously heard us complaining about the situation and sarcastically told us how the dish was hot because it was freshly out of the oven. At that point we asked for a manager and he said he'd get one.  We continued to wait for at least another 10 minutes before anyone even came back to our section. We asked the next employee that came into our section if we could please get a manager. She said that they were waiting for him.  At this point the table across from us also started complaining about the food and lack of service. The proceeded to put all their food on the edge of the table to be removed. After another 5 minutes going by and still no manager or even an employee telling us a manager is on the way, we decided to just get up and leave.  We passed our waiter on the way out and he was busy cleaning an empty table.  We told him we were leaving and all he had to say was, ""ok"".  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?  Now, we're here eating at FIREBIRDS with exceptional food and exceptional service.  As many times as we've eaten there and ordered takeout, unfortunately we will NOT be giving them our business.",0,0,-1
9,"So I will start off by saying that I do not live here but I went to the community for a tour on a Sunday. At first my boyfriend and I were really impressed with the community and were super excited to find an affordable place that was literally right next to Desert Ridge. The unit we toured was a B4 on the 4th floor. How cool is is that there's an elevator?! Also, the unit came with a garage...it wasn't a personal garage as you have to share it with four other units so if someone leaves their door open or if it breaks, someone has access to up to 8 cars. Either way, it's better than the traditional car port. 

Here's what turned us off...we toured the unit ""as is"" and the assistant manager explained that they could upgrade the unit and that he'd show us the model. He said that the upgrades cost about $300-$400 and that the rent would go up a little bit. He also mentioned that they were offering $500 off the total move in. 

The model unit was really nice complete with hard wood inspired floors in the common areas, a really nice back splash, and cabinets above the fridge. As we made our way into one of the bathrooms we were greeted by a small dead cockroach. Now, this is alarming because a lot of the residents were complaining in recent reviews about the complex being infested with roaches and worms. We noticed that it was a small cockroach and not a large sewer roach. This is important because the small ones are the ones that infest places by laying eggs whereas a sewer roach is usually a one off and isn't indicative of a place being infested. 

We left the complex with John, the assistant manager, stating he would follow up with us regarding whether or not they could upgrade the unit for us and how much it would cost. 

On Thursday I heard back and he explained that the rent on upgrading the unit would be $1,370. The rent on the non-upgraded unit was $1,199. Hold up! That's more than just ""a little bit"" of an increase not to mention kind of a rip off if the upgrades only cost $300-$400. Also, on their website, it says that they're offering $500 off the first months rent but when we went in there John said its $500 off the move in. Total bait and switch. Let's examine that a little more...

$500 off the move in....well they're waiving the security deposit on approved credit and not charging an admin fee and we don't have any pets. The hold deposit is $100, which gets applied to the rent upon move in...so where is the $500 going toward? Makes no sense. It seems they're offering a promotion while not offering one. Also, what's on the website is totally different from what you're told by management. For that reason, I now don't trust them. Plus, we were told the rent would increase ""a little bit"" if the unit was upgraded. $170/month is not a little bit and honestly, it's not worth it to live in a roach motel. 

In regards to the roach infestation, I asked John about this and he said the old manager was responsible for it and that the new manager is spraying more often. I don't know if I buy this because Tipton has owned the property for a year and the reviews mentioning the infestation were very recent, some within a few days. Plus, if there is a roach problem, spraying and giving your residents cancer is NOT the solution. The only way to rectify this is to fumigate. 

I was displeased with the email communication between John and I as he seemed very short like he couldn't be bothered. I'm sure they'll rent that unit out to some poor unfortunate soul...it won't be us, however.",2,2,-1

Let me set the stage...customer calls in to ask a couple questions about their most recent prescription. 

The lady answered the phone said she would need to put me on hold. No problem until it ended up being over 25 minutes. I made the call from the driveway of my home and just ended up driving there...STILL ON HOLD. When I walked in I found that they weren't that busy at all. The supposed assistant manager and another associate were standing at the counter.

3,"I would give the Red Devil 3 stars but something changed my mind. 

First the food, the food was bland, it really didn't have any taste. I tried my friends grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo, with broccoli. The broccoli had more taste than the sauce, that was all I could taste was broccoli.

I had the Red Devil ""Trio"". Which consisted of 1/3 fettuccine alfredo. It tasted the same minus the broccoli. I was not overly impressed. 

A friend I was communicating with advised the pizzas/wings are what is good there. I would say I would go back and try them (regardless of the price being a bit high). Now to my ultimate reason I will not return

2,"Premier avis, et je choisis de donner une étoile. Mais vraiment, le stade Olympique... pas fantastique.

Je me rappelle y être allée lorsque j'étais jeune et les Expos y jouaient. Je n'y étais pas allée depuis plusieurs années lorsque je suis allée à la finale de l'est de la CFL. Disons que l'endroit était mieux dans mes souvenirs.

Tout débute avec une minuscule entrée, mal située et difficile à trouver. Puis, on entre à l'intérieur et on est en choc devant l'état des lieux : clairement, aucune rénovation n'a été faite depuis longtemps. Ensuite, on remarque l'uniforme du personnel qui est clairement le même depuis 1970... Du jaune fluo et rouge pour l'équipe de sécurité, ça n'inspire pas un sentiment de sécurité. Et que dire du costume des vendeurs de peanuts dans les allées... Un beau kit bleu, blanc et rouge sans forme qui n'a visiblement pas évolué depuis quelques années!

Il n'y a pas que ça, qui est désolant, au stade. Il est difficile d'imaginer une pire ergonomie pour un endroit qui peut accueillir autant de gens. Des couloirs mal faits, des mauvaises signalisations, des toilettes avec uniquement quatre cabines (!) et presque aucune option pour monter aux niveaux supérieurs...

Pour résumer, une amie a choisi de surnommer le stade Olympique, le stade LOLympique. Je crois que ça veut tout dire.",2,1,-1

0,"Overall I like this store - it is sort of the (recent) modern version of a grocery store with a in-house restaurant, lots of ready to go cooked food, large meat, seafood, cheese and bakery departments - however, the selection can be hit and miss sometimes, and the prices are a bit high. But my main problem is with their catering. Definitely 'beware' with this... here's my story.

I've eaten from their catering before - a few years back we fell into the 'take out' Thanksgiving dinner from them and it was pretty good. I think we tried a few salads and things right from their deli as well and it was all OK. This Summer we went to a graduation party. They had it catered from Hyvee and it was amazing! Yummy burgers, juicy pulled chicken sandwiches and a number of side dishes - a few floating in ice baths to keep everything chill on a hot day. 

Next comes my daughters birthday party. We decide to order the same thing mentioned above since it was SO good at our friends party. I ordered from this (Whitney Way) Hyvee instead of from my friends Hyvee (East Washington). Bad move on my part. The food was delivered and on time. They set up the hot trays for us - but we had to dump in the food. No ice baths. The rolls were delish and the side dishes were mostly OK - but the meat was awful. The burgers were super thick and super dry and tasteless. The chicken was SO dry it was awful. I don't think many of our guests even wanted to try it. We were embarrassed it was so bad. The beans had really way too much vinegar or something in them too. Couldn't hardly eat them. Fruit salad was good, but how do you screw that up. 

We complained afterwards, but sort of got this 'oh you're kidding?' response and that's about it. I would think twice about ordering party catering from here. Very expensive for very low quality food. Stick to the store food where you can see what you are getting for.",0,0,-1
