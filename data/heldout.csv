6,"Dang, this place was healthy and delicious AF! I was getting pretty tired of eating chicken and brown rice with veggies PLAIN at home and I was meeting up with an old pal for lunch and we were both feeling that healthy vibe so we chose Buddha Bowls as out meet up spot.

It's a small place (maybe 8-10 seats) and to my knowledge, there isn't parking readily available to street parking is the answer. It's great for lunch takeaway for people on the go for sure, and I believe I overheard that they are partnered with local food delivery services as well. Definitely order in from here!

As the staff explained, this place is basically like Subway, without the bread (and bad cheese). You start by choosing a base (brown or white rice or cold noodles) then a protein, followed by veggies, a curry sauce (mild, medium and hot) and then some tasty garnishes.

Today I went with brown rice and chicken (I know, I know this was exactly what I wanted to avoid but it sounded so much better how THEY made it), topped with lentils, kale, green curry (the spiciest one), peanuts, cilantro, zucchini and green beans. Dynamite!!! 

It was very filling, but not in the ""I'm so full and sleepy now"" kinda way, more like, ""my body feels full of goodness and it's using all these fresh ingredients to fuel my body"" way. Long description but you get it, don't you? I felt great - still do in fact 2 hours later.

I appreciated all the rice, I would have loved less rice and more meat but I understand that to maintain their reasonable pricing (about $10/person), they do have to monitor portions.

That aside I'm a big big fan and I will return, hungry

There were seven of us, and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table at 530.  Once we were seated the service was okay, definitely not fast, but not really slow.  The wife and I split a caesar salad and a basil/garlic pizza.  The caesar got poor reviews from both of us.  The pizza was just ok.  It did get better as I ate more, but it wasn't super, nor was it horrible.  Maybe slightly better than average.  

Another drawback is that it was quite loud.  We were probably 75% of the way through the meal before I was able to identify that they were playing music in the restaurant, and that the music was Christmas Carols.  They did seem to have the ability to accommodate large parties, so that is nice, and they were showing a couple football games in the bar.  I guess I'd go back, but there are plenty other pizza places I like better or would like to try.",0,0

1,"I give a 4 because of the annoying oriental music playing in the room all the time.  When you leave the room the maids turn it back on.  Not relaxing to me.  I  understand why they do it because this is a spay hotel with an oriental them.  If I turn music off I want it off.  Other than that very nice.  No smoking hotel! And no casino.  Perfect because after speeding day and night in smoking hotels and casinos you need a break.  Of course you can get spay service for $$$$.  Think a few hundred or more. Elevator system to get to room confusing.  They also
Don't allow you to leave hotel on check out morning without going by main desk.  Elevator would not go down.  Maybe they turn it off at certain hours.  But overall good experience. The Asian fusion bistro is very good.",1,0
11,"One of my girlfriends who moved to Vegas about a year ago wanted to take me out on a dinner date. 

Rather than perusing through Yelp, I opted for her to call the shots on where to take me. Now that's a rare occasion since more often than not, I do the cuisine-suggesting. The change was definitely nice and made for a few pleasant surprises.

She picked me up from MGM and took the backroads, clearly well off the strip to a local hang out called Herbs & Rye. 

Upon entering, you definitely are taken aback by how dark it is in there. Seriously, your eyes don't quite fully adjust until you are seated. We got there in the early evening and it was starting to get packed. Fortunately, my girl made reservations and we were situated in one of their awesome booths facing the bar. 

You don't have pages and pages of menu to peruse through. Their offerings are simple and to the point, no frills here. Don't get me wrong, just because the menu isn't laced with words you can't pronounce or ingredients you've never seen, doesn't mean quality has been sacrificed. On the contrary, the seem to use products of utmost quality with particular attention to the entree's final outcome.

We had  a wonderful server, I'd like to say his name was Richard though I'm no longer sure. He was warm without being overbearing, made us laugh a little and suggested deliciously buttery chardonnay for me. 

BTW happy hour is awesome here, but many of their dishes, yes even the steaks at 50% off!

We ordered:
Carpaccio - i have never had carpaccio before and this was just amazing. I would order this again in a heartbeat

New York Strip - We added bacon and oh my was that a thick cut piece of pork! They prepared it medium rare and seasoned just right

Truffle Mac n Cheese - Although not too truffle-y, this mac n cheese was still a hit

Sweet Potato Tots - We got this with the marshmallow crust. heaven in your mouth. geez.

Mind you they have a very impressive selection of cocktails as well.

We skipped dessert this particular time since we were going somewhere else for our sweet treats. Regardless, our meal was fantastic and kudos to the folks at Herbs & Rye for the stellar experience.",1,4
1,"Just another Bouchon Review ...but hey...it's my first time there !!  on my SO's days off  we tend to sleep in late so our first meal is usually at 2-4 pm...not exactly the best time to eat at a restaurant ...is there a  word similar to brunch for the timeframe between lunch and dinner...Linner ?!?! Anyways, made a couple $$$ on the tables so decided to splurge and ordered the foie gras pate....$48 for 5 oz. ...it ain't cheap but it is delicious !!! ( i added pics of our meal ) 
 the food selection  was limited... we  were told it's their bar menu - SO had the lamb sammie, i had the ham croquette sammie...both came  with a huge pile of french fries...can't remember if the menu said pommes frittes or not !!  the fries  were very tasty a little more on the salty side but i like them that  way.

The sammies  were very good - loved the perfectly cooked egg on top of my sammie  with the silky smooth sauce...the lamb  was delicious but SO and i agreed a little too much onion on top.

the foie gras served as our appetizer and dessert .

 we really loved the look of this place, the garden/patio next to it and the feeling that you are far remved from the vegas hustle ... we agreed that  we have to give this place a try during normal biz hours...especially at dinner",0,0
6,"** If you are a person with any underlying medical conditions, PLEASE consider reading my review before getting a massage at this place! **

I was on vacation out here (I'm from St. Louis) and decided I really wanted a Thai foot massage. I'm a student in a massage therapy program and have always been really interested in Eastern medicine, and had heard through locals that this area was perfect for just that. I chose Master Spa based on the awesome reviews since I don't know the area very well. Like others have mentioned, it's pretty basic, but that didn't really phase me since I really just wanted an authentic experience. The place was clean, quiet, small, and the lights were dim enough for that super mellow feel. A young woman started working on my boyfriend first, then another gentleman a little while later came out to work on me. I found it interesting the woman was wearing gloves (which I sincerely hope were nitrile, NOT latex! A huge part of the population are allergic!) Even if she had open wounds on her hands, I can't justify why she would need gloves (they make airtight bandaids) - and if you don't like touching people, why are you in this occupation (?) Anyway, interesting. The guy plopped down without much of a greeting and just started working on my feet. I briefly explained that I had sort of tender feet from being on them so much, and he nodded. I found it interesting that there were no basic questions asked (aka: are there any areas to stay away from, what type of pressure would you like, etc.) I told him how I was a student and then asked a few questions about reflexology and what kind of training they get to be licensed. I don't know if he thought I was grilling him (I wasn't, I was only curious and wanting to know more about the culture) but he became very flustered and hesitated when I used the word ""licensed."" However, it was a decent foot massage, the dude definitely knew what he was doing.

They both ended their massages around the same time. When it was time to pay, they harassed my boyfriend that he wasn't tipping them enough (they wanted $10 each for a 30 min foot massage) and when he said he was only doing $5, the woman mumbled to the man ""such little money"" in Chinese (which my boyfriend fluently speaks...whoops!) It was incredibly awkward. Demanding a 50% tip? Wasn't going to happen, it wasn't like they used a ton of materials or anything. What's more, the guy didn't start my massage until maybe 5 minutes after my boyfriend had (but they both ended at the same time), so it wasn't even a full 30 minutes

All in all: if you have any medical conditions, I do NOT recommend going here, the people just don't seem to understand enough English to know how to personalize the massage, which could lead to an injury (and I really do question if any of them had any official licenses or formal training). If you're looking for an authentic Thai massage without the bells and whistles, this might be the right place for you :)",3,0
1,"Totally and thoroughly disgusted with this hospital!!!!!  My daughter went to an urgent care for her migraine that she has had for two weeks and also was very dizzy and unstable, they said ""we have called the hospital and they are expecting you.  You need to go immediately and get a scan of the head.""  She was VERY scared but followed the directions and went to the hospital.  When she checked in (which took 1hr) they told her to ""wait"".  She, in the mean time, was trying not to throw up and was very lightheaded and they did NOTHING.  I understand Triage but when an urgent care calls in and told them she was coming and why they should have been more receptive.  She sat there for about 2 hrs. in pain with her head ready to split wide open and NO ONE CARED.  I live in Florida and was ready to get on a plane to come to her, but she (she is a trooper) said she would be ok she was in the hospital so if anything happened it would be ok.  Her fiancée was finally able to get to her (he is in the Air Force) and they basically were ignoring them which is absolutely horrid.  Finally after about 3 hrs. she got an IV with some medication to ease her migraine.  
For all we know (due to no scan) she could have had an aneurysm and we STILL don't know what is wrong because of complete incompetence.  I will be taking this further - possibly to my lawyer!! 
Thank you UMC for shoddy patient care and complete disreguard for patience and their well being.  I thought you were a HOSPITAL but apparently you are only a shlock operation.",1,1

3,"A must on anybody's Toronto best eats bucket list. Can't speak for any other location to get Sukho Thai but this little restaurant tucked at Parliament and Dundas had all the charm and cozy for me to want to go back stat. Small and just shy of hip, has you focussing on the food rather than the decor. Serves mean Thai cuisine, right up there with Pai and Khao San Road.

Chicken pad thai ($15.50) - amazingly delicious. Recommended dish for everyone, way different from the mall foodcourt dish you're used to. Sweet, savory, flavorful. Complicated combination of ingredients but all you can taste or think of is perfectly cooked noodles... enough for you to dismiss the cost. 5/5

Beed khao soi ($15.50) - also amazing. Soup was heavy with amazing flavour. Taste notes and textures diverse. Had me going in for the next bite before I finished the one I was working on. 4.5/5

Thai iced tea ($4.50) - served in a large mason cup, dense, orange tea topped with a thick layer of condensed milk. Drink slowly to allow the ice to melt some into the drink. A must! 4/5

Very happy with this dinner decision! Service was quick and accurate. Overall rating 4.5/5",0,2
4,"I can't speak for too many things on the menu here, as every time I've been here I'm seduced by the moules et frites. They aren't my favorite rendition in town, but they are deliciously, classically prepared, with plenty of golden, crispy fries (which will inevitably be snitched by your dining companions who've made other choices). On our last visit we also indulged in the cheese board, and the only problem with that is having to choose which of the many cheese selections to include (my favorite was the Ewe Calf to be Kidding). Of course, for the beer drinkers, there is a long list to choose from, but for those of us who prefer wine, the selection isn't half bad, either.",0,4
3,"I have been a customer of this Firestone location for the last 5 years. My car is on the older side and they have gotten a fair amount of business out of it over those years with some not-so-insignificant repairs in the mix. They've always done a fine job. So, it was only natural to call last week on Thursday morning when I found coolant leaking underneath my car. 

Worst.
Decision.
Ever.

From the very first phone call, it felt like nothing but an inconvenience to bring them my business. After enduring some attitude from the person on the phone, they eventually they decided it was ok for me to drop my car off on Saturday morning. When I did, I was asked if I wanted them to just figure out what was wrong with it, or if I would want them to fix it too. Well, yes, please fix my broken car - this is why I'm bringing it to you. Then I was told if it needed a repair, it would likely take until Sunday afternoon. Fine. I didn't hear from them the rest of the day. Or the next morning. I finally called THEM on Sunday afternoon for a status update and low and behold they did have a quote in the system for the repair, just no one had called to discuss it with me. Can't start the work without an ""ok"" on the quote first. Furthermore, they now had no one working that could do the repair that day, but stated that someone would be in tomorrow that could repair my radiator. So they kept my car another night. 

Monday afternoon rolls around and I get a call stating that, in fact, they couldn't get to my car again and would need to keep it until Tuesday to perform the repair. Now we are at 6 days that I haven't been able to drive my car, 4 of which were spent literally just parked at this Firestone. 

I was finally able to pick up my car at the END OF DAY on TUESDAY, for a radiator repair. When I voiced my frustration, I didn't even receive so much as an apology for the delay. 

As convenient as this location is, I will never bring my business back. So long Firestone.",0,0

8,"If you are someone who sees the fashion in art, and the art in fashion, you will enjoy this mall.

Not only does this shopping center boast couture shops like Lanvin, Balenciaga, Dior and Versace (did you say ""Foe-Sa-Chee!?"") to name a few, but the architecture and art displays here are AMAZING.  So even if your pockets aren't deep enough to drop a G on some new Jimmy Choo heels, or a Kiki de Montparnasse brassiere.... or a few more G's on Harry Winston Ice, there is still a lot of artful eye candy to enjoy just by window shopping and walking around in the spacious corridors. And in my experience, the workers in the boutiques have been briefed with the Pretty Woman memo, who are courteous and helpful even to flip-flop wearing and leftovers-in-plastic-bag carrying gals like me.  They did, however, back up slowly in caution when I started drooling over the shoes. ;)

The Rodney Lough gallery never ceases to amaze me with the wonderful landscape photography, and The Gallery, which has Dale Chihuly's glass artwork featured (he has installations at the Bellagio too), is simply breathtaking.

2,"I'm surprised no one else has reviewed this yet! I guess I'll be the first. Let me start with the good: Everyone on staff was super nice, and the ride along in a dragster was SO FUN. 

Now onto the reasons I only gave them 3 stars. 
Organization is not something this place is familiar with. Neither is punctuality. We signed up for a ride along, and scheduled an appointment time. Not sure why we had an ""appointment"" since it was disregarded as soon as we got there. We thought (and the website led us to believe) that we were getting an individualized experience. We were not. There was a group of people there also for a variety of activities. We were not split up into groups based on our activity. People there for ride alongs had to sit through the lesson on how to drive a dragster yourself. Why? Also, we had to wait over an hour and a half past our appointment time for our actual ride. Why? Because the ride along driver wasn't there. Not sure why he couldn't get to work on time, but we were forced to wait because of it. Also, they hadn't prepped the track yet!! They KNEW they had ride alongs and rides that day, they KNEW they would be using the track, and yet didn't prep it until we were all there waiting. Furthermore, they didn't even have all their machinery to prep available. We had to wait even LONGER for them to get their machines ready. Finally, when the driver arrived and the track was ready, we were then told we had to wait for some other people to go before us (who had later appointment times and got there after us) because they signed up for both a ride along and to drive a dragster. Not cool.

My recommendation to this place is to GET ORGANIZED. Having people make an appointment and then making them WAIT FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF is unacceptable. But I guess they don't care because there's no refunds, so it's not like I could complain about their bad service and get my money back. Furthermore, I wasn't about to complain to people who were going to have my life in their hands going 144mph. 

If you decide to go for a dragster ride along or private drive, make sure you don't have anything else going on that day.",0,0

I used to think that the sides were normal and that they were supposed to be really sweet/sour (and I feel most of their side dishes taste this way), but after eating at some other restaurants that have better-tastings sides and also offer more sides, I don't enjoy the sides at Kachi anymore.

Id still come here for the seafood pancake, I think that they make that pretty well here it's very crispy and delicious. 

Their pork bone soup used to be one of my favorites but again I have found cheaper places where the bones tear apart easier and the meat is much more tender :(. T
he spicy noodle rice cake was also one of my favs but they now make the portion ridiculously huge in a bowl so that the noodles and rice cakes at the bottom get soggy quick.

Our waiter, Daniel, was very personable and offered suggestions to my wife as to the chili sauce that was served with her meal.  She was a bit timid about things spicy and when she heard Jalopenos she veered away.  With a little coaxing though she tried it and then ate it all.
She had a pork burrito which she gave a 4 star to.  I had a pollo fundido  which was good and certainly had a LOT of chicken in it.  I'd give mine four stars also  because I'm a pushover ofr lots of melted cheese.

0,"Located just steps from the Bellagio North Entrance you'll find Chef Akira Back's Yellowtail, his first of two restaurants in the city. It's an upscale, trendy setting so you can have a fine dining experience without the stuffiness. It overlooks the Bellagio Fountains but honestly it doesn't enhance your experience. The prices are higher than most will expect to pay for Japanese food but you get what you pay for in terms of quality. I will preface this next part by saying I don't eat seafood. Still, I believe I can do justice to this review. 

The restaurant has a lounge area at the entrance overlooking the casino. You'll pass the bar area and small high top tables on the way to their larger, open main dining room. The lights are dim and the noise level is loud enough to feel busy but not so overbearing that it drowns out conversations. I've been here many times (it is one of my favorite restaurants, after all) and the service is great for the most part but it isn't consistently stellar. Still, most times they are friendly and attentive. The food is spectacular in taste and presentation. Have the Big Eye Tuna Pizza start you off. Other great appetizers include the Alaska King Crab Tempura and the Rock Shrimp. Their rolls are good (popular ones include the Happa, Mile High, and Protein Roll) but my vote goes to the Poppin' Spicy Crab Roll because it's pretty unique. When moving to entrees a must is their Jidori Chicken. Don't question me, just do it. You'll be glad you did. For variety get the Filet Mignon Toban - or simply refer to it as the ""Sizzling Plate."" Yes, I know you can get more for less by ordering the Black Angus Ribeye but this tastes better. 

Desserts aren't elaborate but they still taste good. My go-to is their Chocolate in a Cup. It's exactly as it sounds. 

Tip: If you value convenience over money valet at the North Entrance off Flamingo - $21 vs $9 parking fee + free hike to restaurant",0,0

4,"I'm conflicted by this place, I'm in love with what I ordered, but I wasn't crazy about the other things I've sampled.

I ordered a turkey sandwich, but I ordered it without bread. Breadless sandwiches are a bit of an oxymoron but the ingredients are so good they can stand alone as its own quirky dish. The turkey sandwich I ordered were thick slices of warm, fresh turkey, slices of avocado, grilled balsamic onions, crispy bacon, and aioli. It was a perfect meal - I loved the saltiness of the bacon paired with the creaminess of the avocado, and the sweetness of the balsamic onions created balance...it was almost the perfect meal for me.

 I had a friend who ordered the same sandwich but (obviously) with the bread. It tasted like completely different! The ciabatta (as much as I love love love carbs) muted all the saltiness I fell in love with, it actually muted all of the flavor. My friend also ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was pretty good, but still not very memorable. I personally feel like the bread hid all of the high-quality ingredients.

My vote? Definitely worth a try, but I dare you to go bread-less, you might like it~",1,2
2,"I didn't write a review of Industry until I tried it twice. The restaurant is always packed which is a great thing, but the noise level makes it impossible to have a conversation at a normal level. I felt like I was shouting across the table when I was in the main room, and even in the side room I was still shouting even though I thought it would be a little easier to carry on a conversation. 

The restaurant has fun vibes and if you're going out just for a drink, it's great, since there's so much room, unlike many places in Pittsburgh, and you can fit a large group. If you're going out for food, I think it's a little pricey for the food you get. The classic burgers and sandwiches aren't anything special. There are better places to eat, even in Lawrenceville that are better worth my time. Will probably be back for drinks and the huge portion of nachos but if you're trying to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.",0,0

Called to cancel because of out of state move they said no problem we will freeze your account till you come back. Yet they forgot to mention during the freeze they would be charing 10 dollars a mth for keeping you eligible to come back. After being blindsided I decided not to join back up. I called in on more than 5 occasions to cancel membership each time I was met with excuses on how they couldnt cancell my acct. Waiting on paperwork to fax into them that never came. Being charged month after month for a membership in another state. Then they threatened to turn me into the credit bureau!  Lol I told them send a physical bill. Apparently they don't do that or email agreements to opt out either. They said give us a new credit card and we promise this is the last payment. Ha! Enjoy paying your own mortgage.

0,"Went for dinner last night (a Wednesday) with a friend, my first time. Firstly, the service was excellent. I arrived 20 minutes before my friend so killed time at the bar, where the staff was incredibly friendly. The bartender offered me complimentary bread as I waited - even though I was only sipping a water until my friend arrived.

Those little breads are amazingly delicious, incredibly flavorful, flaky and moist - they almost stole the show from my dinner.

The interior is very nice. We ended up sitting in a generously-sized but very nice booth. (I'm a big girl so worry about sitting in booths that may be too small to accomodate me, but no problems here). The table and combination booth/chair seating looked great and very comfortable. 

My dinner was very, very good. The salmon was crispy and very well seasoned on the outside, and flaky/juicy on the inside. I really would go so far as to say that it was the best-tasting restaurant salmon I've had. The shrimp skewer had a very smoky flavor, just divine. My side was the tomatos covered in balsamic dressing, which tasted as expected, nothing great but not bad at all.

The broccoli/cheese soup had one minor flaw, it was a little too salty for my taste. However, when I bit into the large, obviously fresh and still crunchy pieces of broccoli, that more than made up for the saltiness.

Unfortunately, we lingered a little too long so did not have time for dessert.

I am most definitely going to go back with family members to introduce them to this restaurant. I understand from other comments that this is a chain, but honestly, it was a great experience so that did not matter at all.",0,0
2,"We took my Dad to the ER here late last night due to a fall and weakness in his arms and legs. We got into a room fairly quickly but then was 6 hours+ of waiting. I get it. I get that it's a hospital and you just sometimes have to wait. And there were likely people there with a lot more severe conditions. However, I have so many grievances. The nurse (Lauren I think her name was) who helped my Dad made a comment to another nurse while taking my Dad's blood that she had been off for 6 days so she didn't know what she was doing. I asked her where I could find water, not once, but twice. I didn't even ask her for free water just a vending machine where we could buy some. She said uhh it's behind the nurses station but I have to get it for you. She never did. My poor Dad was shivering cold and not once did they offer him a blanket, my mom had to ask a different nurse for one. Even though the nurse Lauren walked by our room and exclaimed ""It's 36° outside!"" The same nurse that wouldn't tell us where to find water didn't come to check on him once other than to say ""Oh I was going to disconnect his IV but it isn't done yet."" And left. We were there from 11p-5a and she didn't come to check on him at all. Much less anyone other than the doctor who came in. A few times throughout the night, the machine my Dad was hooked up to blinked red and beeped loudly. No one came to check on that or my Dad. Admittedly, I am far from any sort of healthcare professional or have any knowledge of it but I assume when something turns red on a monitor and it's making a beeping noise clearly designed loud enough for people to hear outside of the room, maybe they should pay some attention to it or the patient. Finally, the billing guy came in with his portable monitor and had my Mom sign a bunch of forms and answer some questions. He wasn't friendly and actually was rude. He was instant messaging his coworkers about non work related things while he was filling out my Dad's paperwork right in front of us. I called him out on it and said ""Are you seriously chit chatting with your friends on instant messenger while you're doing my Dad's paperwork?"" and he said ""oh it's because I'm telling them what form I need."" I said yeah sure. He said I can tell you don't believe me but okay. I said it's because I don't and could see what you were writing. Granted, he wasn't talking about my Dad. But how EXTREMELY unprofessional. You can't focus for 5 minutes on what you're doing? I asked the nurse for his name and she said she didn't know. I tried to look at his name tag in passing and so think it said Wilson, Winston or maybe William. He was a tall man of Asian decent with glasses on wearing an orange shirt. Sadly, my Dad is still there under this terrible care waiting for some answers. This hospital is a JOKE and their whole ""humankindess"" is just a slogan for money. Because we didn't experience an ounce of it while we were there. I am so frustrated and disappointed. I get that other patients take precedence for more dire situations, but when the nurses don't even check how you're doing or bother to provide a blanket or water, this place is clearly just out for insurance money only and a paycheck. We didn't want to be there all night, I'm sure the staff doesn't enjoy working all night. But in that case please find a new job where you don't have to help people. Find any other hospital than this. They aren't kind and they won't help you.",0,0

We got a chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, and garlic naans. The ticken tikka and aloo gobi were quite good and the portion sizes were impressive. On the other hand the garlic naan and the papadum was hugely dissapointing....

The complimentary papadum was SOGGY, like the texture of chips left out with the bag open during humid summee rain. The garlic naan had barely any garlic taste to it and it was very thin.

The service was on the meh side and the waiter/bartender/owner was really bad at answering any questions I had. The beef slices weren't as appetizing-looking as some other pho places I've been to but the taste was all right.

5,"3.5 stars. Been here on several visits and have noticed improvements each time. 

Pros:

- Modern upscale decor, clean restaurant inside despite how it looks outside
- Awesome bar area
-Food is good, nothing spectacular. Not very authentic Viet food (definitely more Americanized) but that doesn't bother me too much.
-Big servings
-Happy hour specials with 40% off appetizers
-Friendly staff...but...

Cons:

-Inefficient staff (seemed very inexperienced in the business, kept forgetting our orders and never wrote them down, kept forgetting to bring our drink orders, and when they did they forgot to refill drinks) 
-Food is good, nothing spectacular
-wish there were more items on the menu

FOOD ITEMS:

-Beef BBQ spring rolls- they take a different twist on it and add avocado, lettuce and hoison sauce marinated beef but its probably my favorite thing on the menu

- Lettuce wraps- chicken, baby shrimp and glass noodles (you know the korean kind) and peanuts for the mix and slices of lettuce served with a the sweet-fish sauce-chili concoction. I had a hard time wrapping this in the lettuce so I ate it on its own and took a bite of lettuce lol. Seriously, it was just like stir fried noodles.

-Pho- Mehhh. I used to live a few miles from Little Saigon so I've tasted good Pho. I would call this broth very bland. However the noodles are cooked al dente and the beef is standard so I would come back here again for it if I was craving pho and didnt want to drive too far. 2.5 out of 5 at most.

- Crispy noodle- this is a popular egg noodle dish that I don't see at a lot of Viet restaurants here but its pretty good. You get a huge portion. It has a meat or shrimp option, vegetables and the sauce reminds me of chop-suey but the noodles are the crispy kind. I would order this again.

-Shrimp and sweet potato tempura. Pretty standard, good if you're a sweet potato lover like me

-Grilled Chicken entree- yummy and comes with a side of their pho broth. Healthy, tasty, big portion

Will continue to come back and try other items and because I like the decor and overall vibe. In the meantime, hopefully the staff will improve, they add more items to the menu and the quality of the pho gets better.",1,1

5,"Holy flipping goodness! This place was an absolute treat, but as Yelp clearly states, bring your checkbook as it is not cheap in the least. With that said you know going in this is a special occasion and one with some spectacular Italian cuisine. The ambiance inside was dark, yet beautiful at the same time. As for the service, top notch, the staff no when to dip in and can easily suggest something that fits your preference. I was unfortunately here for business, so phones usually go on silent and hidden away for meals, but will break down the apps and mains we ordered. 

Beet Salad - 8/10 
Various breads with butter and oil - 9/10
Caesar Salad - 10+/10 - Do not miss out on this show and dish.
Rib Eye - 10/10 - Wow...just wow..
Chicken - 10+/10 - Some of the most moist and delish chicken I have had in some time.
Tiramisu & Cheesecake - 8/10 - Not a huge Cheesecake guy, but it was good. Tiramisu was phenomenal though!

So with all of that said, people were not kidding about the caesar salad. They pull out a cart and hand craft the whole thing for you (Dressing and all), right in front of you. I still dream about those croutons to this day, I wish I could get a bag of them to go. As for the ribeye and chicken, I have only been wowed a few times in my life, and this was one when it comes to those dishes. Cooked to perfection, moist, marinated just enough, but not too much to take over. I was just in a state of bliss while munching away, not going to lie. As for the desserts, I am usually a gelato/ice cream guy, but they were fantastic and I am sure the others with me would have the same comments as me. As mentioned in the very beginning this is an experience you would not want to miss if you are staying at the ARIA or just nearby and really want to splurge on a meal and or experience.",3,5
3,"Housed in the place previously known as Fate, Matt Carter of Zinc Bistro and The Mission and Chef Jay Bogsinske have finally opened up their newest restaurant after many months of construction.  This is one of three in this location that will be opened, coming soon, Canteen and El Rey...so I've been told.

After you get through the very heavy front door (grandma is not going to eat tonight if she has to handle that door) you'll notice the place has been improved quite nicely with metal framed windows, door frames and a large mirror.  Also notable are the 70s style prints throughout the cozy space.  Although it's still warm (they're working through A/C issues), you'll find the staff and kitchen (visible) will greet you with a smile and in our case at the soft opening, a choice of a glass of chilled chardonnay or a cold sake!

The menu is still in flux and not all items were available, but the selection was still quite large.  We sampled quite a few items and in most cases, they were all very tasty.  The prices for the items available ranged from $8 to $13 for the starters, and when the full entrees are available, they appear to be in the $15-20 range. 

Bottles of wine are $30-40, with glasses from $8-13.  The selection is fairly minimal with only about 7 reds and 5-6 whites from Spain, New Zealand, South America, and California.  Cold Sakes are $12 for 300ml (a bit high) and there are about 5 choices.  I find these prices slightly high for the quality of wines and sakes available, but at the bottled wine price, not so bad.  As much as I love chilled sake, unless there is a special I probably will pass unless the quality improves.

Food:  Along with the fantastic service, we found the food to be very delicious.  We started with the duck confit buns, which are really a play on Hong Kong style duck where you'd make up your bun, crispy duck skin, hoisin sauce and shrimp cracker...  however this version consisted of a larger Hong Kong style steamed bun, duck confit, a different play on the sauce and green onion along with a slice of green apple.  I thought the confit was good, but not excellent (like Christopher's), the steamed bun too sticky (over steamed?) but all around not a bad effort.  I think this one can only improve and I will try it again as I love confit.  This was the only item I thought that needed some work, it could have just been the gooey bun that threw me off.  

All of the other items were top notch, very flavorful and perfect temperatures with the right amount of seasonings.  Some items such as the Shrimp and Coconut fried rice were spicier than you'd expect but well within reason and added a little kick to make them perfect. 

The fried rice was excellent, I really loved having the texture of the shaved coconut with the rice and although a lot of egg, it was the perfect amount to make it rich and delicious.  I would actually prefer a small poached egg or overeasy quail egg on the top just to get some yolky goodness, I guess I'll have to do that at home with the leftovers...

The shrimp lettuce wraps were among my favorites, nice spicy perfectly fried shrimp in a cool lettuce wrap.  As all starters come in threes, these are difficult to share with two....  I will order this again next time, it's a nice cool and spicy treat.

My very top favorite was the pork belly crepe.  Although the crepe in texture was not so different from the 'bun' of the confit dish, the crepe with the pork belly is absolutely magnificent paired with the wasabi yogurt.  This was pork belly at its best (well, yes, Filipino fans, you know the other best pork belly), but Matt's subtle and delicious pork is among the tastiest I've had.  He knows his pork and the belly he serves here in several incarnations is well worth the trip.

The last dish was dessert, which the wife had the blueberry (cake?) and lychee ice cream all made on site.  Very sweet but perfectly delicious.  I cannot pass up tapioca and this paired with toasted coconut, strawberries, and butterscotch was a fine finish to a terrific meal.  I actually might have preferred the tapioca with only (add more please) coconut, but the overlarge (shareable) portion was a nice subtle and not oversweet finish to a very nice meal.

This is a nice destination for a delicious meal and I can't wait for the weather to cool off so that they can open up the large garage doors and open the interior to the beautifully set up patio.  Inside they have about 11 tables (2 and 4 tops) and outside looks like a treat once the weather behaves.  I think this is going to be a hot spot when the cool weather starts.",0,2

0,"Let me begin by saying I love Arby's.  However, the lack of customer service and numerous errors make this location one to avoid.  In the past I have used the drive through at this location on multiple occasions and have never had a good experience.  One time when I was there I witnessed two employees blatantly flirting and ignoring me trying to hand them my card.  Tonight I got to watch as an employee named Isabel messed up our order in numerous ways.  I ordered two drinks with my food, one regular and one diet.  When she was filling the diet drink the cup leaned over onto the Mt dew side and started filling up with mt dew.  She saw this and quickly out the drink back to the diet dispenser.  She did not empty the drink or start over.  When she went to hand me the drinks I asked her if she could redo the diet drink.  She said there was no reason because none of the Mt dew made it into the glass.  I personally saw the Mt dew make it in the drink and I know she did as well.  She handed me the drinks and I conceded.  Thinking, wow this is the most bizarre interaction I've had with someone over a drink.  

Fast forward with me now.  I'm back home and eating with my family.  I had spaced it at the time but I remembered once I was home that I ordered and paid for an apple crisp for my wife.

9,"Don't try this at lunch. The downtown Las Vegas Greens and Proteins is a Grand Central Station double during the weekdays from roughly 11:30-1:30. Better for you to come at the off times. You will wait a bit for your meal, either way, but at least in the off times you won't be shoulder to shoulder with other hangry would be diners. 

This location is one of the newer ones in the G&P enterprise. It is definitely more trendy and urbane than its Henderson and Summerlin cousins. There are on trend avocado banquettes, and neon green chairs, replete with pop art posters.

The food is solidly on the healthy end. There are interesting avenues of bowls, salads, rice and potato dishes with a variety of vegetables and ""'garden variety"" of proteins. You name it, and they usually have it, tuna, egg, cod, shrimp, beef, and tofu. The food is decent. I had a very good short rib taco here that would have rivaled whatever hot fusion restaurant is doing the now. But other dishes can be a bit lackluster or not well thought out. A salad with ahi tuna did not come together so well. The ingredients did not so much complement each other as clash and vie for attention. And they were not uniformly cut. Long carrots and short cucumbers, you get what I mean. That doesn't just take away from the aesthetics of the dish, but also eating enjoyment. (It's harder to get everything on your plate when you you're wrangling different sized bites of salad, especially when eating in front of your work colleagues at a meeting.)

Perhaps the best part of this trendy, cafeteria style dining establishment is that they have calorie counts of most, if not all, of their dishes. That's super convenient, almost a life hack. If you're watching your waistline, but don't want to go to the ""healthy fare"" section of your favorite fast food joint (which will usually have nutrition information), you can come here and eat with friends or associates, and not panic that you're not keeping track of the numbers. That's harder to do when you go to other restaurants with no online or hard copy of their nutrition info. Also, they have a special HCG menu just for those on that unique 500 calorie a day diet.",5,5

See them putting a bag together and gave the benefit of the doubt thinking it was mine, so we go back to the car.  Wait and wait,  yet nothing.  Get out again,  now we've been waiting 25 minutes.  I tell a ""manager"" that I've been waiting curbside for 25 minutes.  She said,  ""oh you're the order"". Sends over another manager.  She told me it didn't charge my card.  Of course I busted out my back statement on my phone showing that I got charged,  plus my emailed receipt.  She calls another,  I'm guessing manager on the phone.  The one on the phone made it seem like I was a liar. The manager that was in front of me at least had my back, telling the one on the phone that I am showing proof of my bank transaction and my e-receipt.

0,"My first visit here was awesome (5 stars), so I returned with a friend. 

Sadly, the second visit was disappointing. My friend ordered a side of coke slaw and didn't like it. So he asked for a new side of fries instead. The fries that were brought out to him were very dark, greasy, and inedible. We looked around at the other diners around us to see if everyone's fries were like that, and they were not. It definitely felt like we were given bad fries because he didn't like his first side of cole slaw. We would have gladly paid extra for the 2nd side, rather than getting burnt fries for free. 

The rest of the food was spot on but I think this instance shows the restaurant's attitude about complaints. They can't accept a complaint when a customer doesn't like something, and they will retaliate by giving you another sub-par side.  Maybe I'm looking too far into this but it was telling that everyone else's fries looked perfect and delish.",1,0
0,"This is a good place to get a steak and they know how cook it to the way you prefer it, I've been known to eat my steak blue rare, and some places don't know what that is so that's a bonus. When you order your steak you have a choice of getting side dishes which you can share which is nice, I normally get the creamed spinach but find it hasn't been as good the last couple of times, asparagus is always good though. One thing to point out is, to be successful, you need two key things, good quality meat and great timing. The people that like it rare, you can't ever overcook it because that would really be a turn off, the chewiness would drive them nuts, for the person that likes medium, medium well, the sight of red or bloody drippings can make them ill.

Even though I like Ruth Chris, I find that the fact they use a truckload of butter to cook their steaks to be the main reason why people love their steaks......its kind of like cheating, who doesn't like butter?",0,1
1,"You know those places you really want to be good but just aren't?  This is one of them.  I'll break it down.

Staff - not very attentive.  There is a giant hole so you can see to the back.  Majority of the time staff was standing there talking with each other or not really in any type of hurry to help customers.  We waiting awhile to get the drinks going.  There was no rush to help or check how our food was, nothing.  I also saw a guy drop a knife when we was carrying dishes to the back, kick it and then just leave it in the corner.  Came out several times and didn't bother picking it up. 

Food - pretty bland all around.  We had the chicken and cheese dip.  I was extremely hungry from not eating all day.  Get the dip and it tasted like a brick of cream cheese with some hot sauce.  No flavor.

Next I had the ""hot"" chicken sandwich.  This was just a deep friend chicken breast.  Pretty over cooked and dry.  The batter had no flavor to it either.  No ""hotness"" to be seen.

We each had beer battered fries with our meals as well.  The fries looked like they should taste crispy but were not.  A majority of mine were flimsy and taste of potato.

All in all - you guys really need to step up your game before it's too late.  I can imagine the real estate your business sits on is an expensive one.  With all these other breweries and restaurants around you, not sure how you are going to survive with mediocre staff and food... probably won't be back any time soon.",0,1
1,"This place is a major disappointment and this review is long overdue. I made reservations to this place based on the chef Pierre Gagnaire's marvelous reviews. The disappointing factor was a bunch of amigos back there cooking. It was a Saturday night in June and there was only a total of 6 tables in an enormous beautiful place. The food was bad.... 

2 glasses of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc $52 (ripoff)
1 bottle of Bien Nacido 2007 Pinot Noir (good)
Pierre's salad appetizer $24 ( it was so so)
Trio of Foie Gras $38 ( weird looking and didn't finish it) :(
USDA Ribeye $60 ( the most disappointing part of the entree! The steak was rubbery and it tasted like it was cooked with Soy sauce!)
Pont Nuef $8 ( forgot what it was)
Mushroom side $8 ( salty)

5,"LVH was good to us. It's off the strip a little, which I appreciated because it's nice to be away from the hustle & bustle. My husband and I stayed here for a last minute birthday getaway for a weekend and I booked this hotel like less than 24 hours before our arrival. I was satisfied with the pricing and it totaled around $225 for two nights including the $40 resort fee (which is a dumb fee, but it's whatever). 

Check-in was smooth & totaled about 7 minutes. We got there after dark so the line was pretty empty. I was fooled & got excited because the service agent motioned my husband and I to come to this secret-looking back room for check-in. I thought we were gonna get an upgrade or something! Not so much, haha.

The room was pretty simple. We had two queen beds, a flat screen TV, and it was pretty roomy. There was a table and two office style chairs. The room was very well-cleaned and well-lit and we were satisfied. The bathroom, on the other hand, was a little on the small side and it's pretty cramped where the mirror and countertop are. The mirror and countertop actually sit right outside of the bathroom and in front of the closet, if that makes sense. We got a non-smoking room but the hotel as a whole still smelled like smoke. But it's Vegas so we weren't too surprised by that.

I can't review the casino, Superbook, or food because we weren't in the hotel much for any of those. We did eat at Vince Neil's Tatuado cantina several times though for the late-night Mexican food and $1 shooters, which were delicious and definitely a plus!

Our main gripes were for the confusing parking and the elevators. Both are really out of the way and are difficult to get to. The second day was smoother but still difficult to navigate through. 

I'd stay at LVH again. It was worth what we paid for and was nice for us overall!",4,4

1,"Food's good, not great but good. Standout dish is the Barbacoa...seriously worth trying. My brother was served his shrimp burrito with shrimp tails still on the little guys, which made for a crunchy(not to mention inconvenient) experience. Cost is reasonable......for Vegas.

The cocktails were very good, the classic margarita and the michelada were ordered several times at our table with no complaints. NOTE: they do a happy hour until 7pm on most nights, but only at the bar!! The happy hour price is nearly 50% off on the margaritas, if your looking to save a buck. If your not eating dinner, they serve drinks in TO-GO cups even at happy hour prices.....very nice!

The best thing about this place is the location inside the Venetian, if you get a table on the ""patio""(which means its not the bar area, hence not included in happy hour) you can sit right next to the water for the Gondola rides and listen to them sing(and watch the couples awkwardly stare at each other.... whilst taking their romantic trip in a circle..... through a hotel made to look like Venice, Italy) . It makes for a bit of a romantic dinner if your into that sort of thing, or at the very least some awesome people watching(im a fan).

Initially they try to stick us with a $3,000 bill, fluffing it up with an overnight stay and sending blood to other labs to ""get a better knowledge of what they are dealing with"" we decided against that and also got her medications. When they brought her back out she was extremely unresponsive and sedated and when I asked a nurse if she was given a sedative she said she didn't know. 
I asked them if my yorkie would survive the night and they said ""of course"". Fast forward that same night, I am awake to my yorkie coughing blood and passing out, so we rush her to the same place and they ultimately have to put her down. As stated before, greedy, unqualified, and spiteful.",0,0

So if anyone knows of a great timeshare in Vegas let me know. It just wont be Hilton i need a place that cares before/during/after your visits providing you with that feeling that they care. Obviously Hilton doesn't and don't understand why they cant see the big picture. For me this delima  is very telling

So we stumble across this place in front of Forever 21 and Starbucks and notice a sizable group of people sampling drinks from large colorful cylinder like containers that look really festive and eye catching. Since initially we were planning to go to Jamba Juice.

We were overwhelmed with the flavor choices that was offered and were told that the juices were made fresh daily. The staff on duty was very friendly and helpful with us. Everything that we sampled was amazing and very refreshing. So I finally decided on the Picante Slush and went for the Spicy Mango flavor. We had to wait no more that 5 minutes for our order despite it being a busy 8.27.16 Saturday evening. However once we got our drink and I was bit greedy and got the large 32oz size but didn't regret it, because it was really good. The sweet and spicy combination and sliced mangoes arranged like a spiraling staircase makes for an awesome photo/video opt. The drink was balance with sweetness and spices that went well together especially after been shopping at the mall for a good 2.5hrs. 

Definitely will be back to try out other flavors. A cool alternative to all the other drink outlet that Fashion Show mall has to offer.",1,3

1,"BOTTOM LINE: Easily my favourite resto on West Queen West (and competition *is* stiff!) that has maintained the same quality over the past few years: friendly service, cozy atmosphere, and tasty, tasty duck!

Cost:
-$15-20 for brunch; $25-50 for dinner (tax and tip included)

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Cozy (read cramped) diner with wooden booths, intimate lighting, and its own vintage Coca-Cola industrial fridge.
-Always aromatically a pleasure to walk into from off the street.

Ordered:
-I eat here semi-regularly and generally find all their offerings delicious!  Here are a few highlights:

1.  Duck!  This dish has gone through a few re-inventions each time I've order it, but at it's core, it's the same delicious duck cooked to juicy perfection.  It's hard to find places that do it right (let alone doing it yourself), and that's probably why I order this dish for dinner almost every time.

2.  Huevos rancheros: After three years, I finally had brunch here!  Be sure to be hungy because the portions are big.  Fried eggs in a tasty salsa black bean sauce with a good amount of kick is the true breakfast for champions.

Service:
-Staff are always cheerful, friendly, and good-humoured.

Conclusion:
-Eat. Here. Now. Or maybe you should try the rest of this strip first and save the best for last.  :)",1,0

For $18.95 per person, all you can eat and drink (pop, that is), that is a great price.

They also have ice cream in three flavours (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla), mango pudding, and canned fruit and sago. I think dessert lost them lots of points with me. It felt like they just threw it on the menu so they can boast their menu has desserts, when it fact they make no effort for it to taste good. 

The tables were somewhat small and hard to fit everything on the table. It didn't help that it was sticky which made me question the cleanliness of this place. They were also super close together so you are really close to your neighbours and their food. We went on a weekend so it was crowded and the noise level was loud.

I made the reservation before hand as required and the woman was rude and short with me on the phone. I just let it be but when we arrived the SAME woman - who didn't say ""welcome"" or anything of that matter, merely looked at us and barked ""Do you have a reservation?!"" upon our entry. When I told her we did and that we had a groupon, her next response was ""Give me your voucher!"" Nothing sweet or pleasant. Just rudeness.

There's nothing quaint about it unless you like fake and dried flowers everywhere and cheap china. But we just chalked it up as their decoration style and settled in. The tea was COLD and weak (no cozy and just a single candle to try and warm it - which never works). The sandwiches were DRY and everything tasted cheap. Our scones weren't even scones - they were CHOCOLATE ALMOND cookie-like things served with devonshire cream and lemon curd (seriously?!) and then sliced melon for the fruit and then some random desserts that were dry and undesireable. Our chickensalad stuffed tomato was bland and to top it all off, I was asked to pay 20% for the service. Apparently they charge you tax for the elegant high tea (which would have been $70 for two people for that HORRIBLE tea service!!!) and they charge you 20% for it!! I was appalled that I spent money on this place, let alone another $20 to cover the tax and the gratiuity. All in all - AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT GOOD HIGH TEA!

It was his birthday, so we went out in on a Tuesday night. The reservation was completely unnecessary. They never even asked for my name.

The space is nice, but it's not a speakeasy. This is closer to just a dark lounge.

Even with a reservation, the only place that you can sit is the bar - which has only a handful of seats. If you want to sit anywhere else, you have to buy table service, which comes with a hefty price tag.

Since we were there early and the larger party hadn't yet arrived, they allowed us to sit away from the bar for a few minutes. We did have to move after about 20 minutes. Luckily, a few seats opened up at the bar.

2,"After an incredibly long year of dental school, I wanted to reward myself and get a facial to bring me back to life. After much research, I booked their signature facial which includes a hydrafacial and some type of laser treatment afterwards. The hydrafacial is nothing like any facial I've had before. It is more of a get to the point facial. If you're looking to zen out, this is not the type of treatment to get. 

Vanessa was the technician and she really knows her stuff. She encouraged questions and was quite gentle. She used vitamin c based products on my skin and they smelled so nice. 
I waited to review until the next day to see how my skin held up and I feel much cleaner and brighter which was what I was after.

The first day, my 31 year old cousin couldn't get in because she forgot her ID (yes, she looks young). The second day, we were disappointed to find out as we entered that there is a $50 minimum food and drink charge per pool chair (the same ones that are free at the ""regular"" Palazzo pool) and a $300 minimum charge for the big square lounging cushions that can fit a few people. The food (by Wolfgang Puck) and drinks aren't cheap but that is still a lot of itmes to purchase for one chair... There was a free area in the shade in the back corner of the Azure area...

4,"I made a mistake hiring this company to install my windows and entry door. I placed my order late July and the salesperson told me it might take 10-14 weeks for the installers to come out. 14 weeks went by without a phone call so I called them. They told me the installers would come the next day. If I didn't call they probably would not have come.The day came and a couple problems arose. First, the installer said he did not have the trims for my door and he would have to come back another day to put them in. Second, when he removed my doorbell there was a screw inside that he said ""for the life of me, I could not get this screw out"" and told me I would need to buy a new one. So, I thought I would try it myself. The screw came out easily and showed it to him. To me, that was a hint of possibly more problems if he couldn't remove one small, lousy screw that I had to take out for him. Thirdly, and the most upsetting problem was when I notice a large crack on one of my windows that they never mentioned to me until I did. They told me it would take 3-4 weeks for the new window to come in. Again, 4 weeks later no phone call so I called. Same story. Someone will be there within that week. Another guy came and he brought the wrong window because the installer wrote the incorrect one to fix! He said it will have to take another 4 weeks. I was not a happy man that day and I called the manager and complained. I recently received the correct window finally.

So, it took 2 months for the job to be 100% complete instead of one day like it should be. Unprofessional and bad customer service.

0,"Came here with a bachelorette party of 20+ girls (yes, I did mean to write 20+ girls).  We were able to negotiate a nice dinner prix fixe menu which came out to about $51 per person.  Included in our meal was:

A shooter of vodka and something else
Mozzarella Di Bufala, Tomato, Basil Pizza
Caesar Salad
Bruschetta
Rigatoni Bolognese
Various Desserts

I was starving by the time we got to dinner at 8:30PM, so all the appetizers tasted delicious to me.  The Caesar Salad may have been my favorite because their dressing was perfectly creamy and not watery, with the right amount of anchovy and garlic flavor.  But, that's not to say that the pizza and bruschetta weren't tasty, because they were!

The Rigatoni was pretty bland.  We didn't have any sort of salt or pepper on the table, and since I was so hungry, I just ate it as is.

Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite part of ANY meal is dessert.  I was definitely looking forward to what we were going to get.  Maybe it was going to be tiramisu or possibly gelato.  Instead, we got one plate to share with 10 girls.  On it were a few chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate one bites of cake, and different flavored macarons.

Before I could even really pick anything, most of the desserts were gone.  I had one bite of the chocolate covered strawberry and gave it to my friend.

3,"This is my favorite place to get coffee in Pittsburgh by quite a large margin. 

The location (which is in the process of moving about 50 feet) is in the heart of the strip, and is a great place to kick off an adventure on a weekend morning in the strip. The baristas are extremely knowledgeable about the drinks and show tremendous skill in making them. Always willing to share knowledge about the different types of coffee and best methods of preparation/consumption. Especially considering they serve ""traditional"" beverages (as opposed to what Starbucks has led us to believe..), the customer education is paramount and they take it very seriously. 

If I could offer some advice, don't add any milk or sugar to this coffee. The baristas are very good at understanding each customer's beverage preferences (more/less milk, flavor profiles, etc.) and tailoring drinks to their needs.

The seating reminds me of the old school cafeteria-type bench seats.  I decided to get my breakfast to go.  I took a look at the menu and placed my order.  I ordered a Valley of the Sun 3 egg omelet with seasonal fresh fruit.  You can get *either* hash browns or the fruit, not both, unless you want to pay extra.  You also get a biscuit.  Since I eat gluten-free, I was told that they had gluten-free bread.  I ordered gluten-free toast with butter.  The server then told me that they didn't have any.  No corn tortillas, either, just flour.  So, no carbs for me.  It was a small amount of fruit (about 4 slices of banana, 3 little pineapple chunks and about 6 grapes.)  The omelet was good, but didn't have much inside it, quantity wise.  Coffee was pretty good.  Much better than Denny's or Village Inn coffee.  I thought it was a little pricey at almost $16 for just one person for breakfast.  I thought afterwards that they should have offered me something to replace the gluten-free toast, but there was no mention of that.  I guess I was just expecting more for the price.",0,0

Two months ago, our youngest cat looked very sick. We found him sitting in the corner of our kitchen and he wouldn't move at all. He was also throwing up clear liquid everywhere. I knew we had to take him to the vet first thing in the morning. To be honest, I called my other vet office first. Why? Because I have been taking my dog to them for 2 years, the doctors are great, and their prices are much more reasonable. However, they did not have any appointments until 3pm that day, and I wasn't sure my cat could hold on until then.

I called All About Cats right when they opened and thankfully, they were able to get me in right away. We were set up with Dr. Berquist. After examining our cat for about 10 seconds, she said "" I know what is wrong with him."" Damn! How quick and awesome is that? So our baby had UTI, which also caused some kidney failure. Poor thing! My only choice at that point was having them do a surgery ASAP. Otherwise, he would have died. 

The surgery went well and the doctors took great care of him while he stayed at the hospital for a few nights. Dr. Berquist was great! She took the time to sit down and talk to us about the whole situation. She even called everyday to give updates and explain test results. Our bill wasn't cheap, but it was worth it because they were able to save him and help him get better with a special diet. Now, 2 months later, he has pretty much recovered and is back to normal.

I started with the parmeggiano-reggiano souffle with fresh peas and asparagus.  It was interesting, but not WOW!  I'm eating a James Beard award winner here!

I then had the linguni with clams.  It was kinda bland and lacked flavor.  I had very few clams as well.  The pasta was kinda dry too, so I don't think it was worth the $30 for the dinner portion of the pasta app dish.  

Everyone was kinda underwhelmed by the whole experience and disappointed because we thought our tastebuds were going to be tantalized but instead we were traumatized.",2,3

7,"I have no idea why this place is called ""Pranksters"", but the joke was definitely on me. After being whisked here by an older crowd, I opened the door and thought I was at the wrong place. This could have been an AARP meeting! The vast majority of customers appeared to be senior citizens.

But it wasn't uncomfortable at all. I played some pool and had some appetizers. Hot wings were decent, but the mozzarella sticks were questionably soft, probably so their regulars could gum them. The waitress was good, and managed to keep making her rounds even though the place was packed.

We jammed out to some covers of 60's music. I was then informed that I had seen only half the bar...

...the other half looks like a completely different place. You can't really hear the live music, the crowd is much younger, and it looks more like a sports bar than a music venue. Why the larger side wasn't used for the venue is a mystery, but I guess having two bars in one makes for interesting times. Just not interesting enough for me to go out of the way. If you get stuck in Scottsdale, do check it out though. It was cheap!",7,3
7,"I popped in to The Beat Coffeehouse after a walking tour of Fremont Street.  It was a nice spot to sit and relax and cool off in the AC after being outside for a couple of hours.  It really reminded me of the coffeehouses I used to hang out in when I was in college.  The whole place seems to be a mishmash of furniture, neighborhoods, and stuff collected at flea markets.  I only had a cold soda, which was bottled, so I can't really comment on the food or drink served in the place, but the menu looked good.  

This really isn't a place I would search out, but if I was in the neighborhood and wanted a tea, I would stop in for sure.",4,7

Ordered the tortilla with mango to start. The chips were literally Doritos. Next, tried the pulled pork burrito. Worst burrito ever. The pulled pork was grey and dry, as if they just boiled it. Not at all how pulled pork is supposed to be. Overall, quite bland tasting. Also tried the fish tacos, which were one of the worst things I have ever tasted. As previously stated above, the taco comes with two tasteless shells that fall apart. The fish was deep-fried and battered but somehow was awful and had no flavour. How can something deep-fried be so bad? Will never return.",3,2

Great seats for the price we paid (and it was opening day!) Even with a sellout crowd, they were able to manage lines pretty quickly outside. My one complaint would be at the particular food stand I went too, the attendant was not well versed or very fast.. So it took over an inning to get my food. I guess I'll cut her slack since she has another 80 games to practice. Will return this season.",0,0

We sat right away and were immediately welcomed by our server Ricardo. He was very helpful with navigating me through the menu. I ordered the super melt without the sauce that accompanies this unbelievable creation. The most incredible part about this burger was the quality of the meat. I usually order it medium because you never know about quaily and it can usually go less or more cooked. My preference is medium rare. I explained this to Ricardo and told him I difer to you on this call. Our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. It was cooked to perfection. Perfect Medium Rare. My warmest regards to the chef. I couldn't be happier because the burger was juicy, extremely fresh quality meat. So much so that it stood out to me in a big way. While enjoying this masterpiece of a burger I was greeted by Eriet (aka, Angel) He stopped by to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything I needed. That's when I told both Ricardo and Eriet how fantastic everything was and thanked Ricardo for his insight ordering me that fantastic super melt Medium Rare. I will definitely be visiting Wahlburgers, Las Vegas again.",0,0

They sat us immediately which was great. Our server was nice, sometimes hard to find, but otherwise not bad. The drink times were a little crazy, it seemed like the only had one bartender for a weekend night so we had to wait quite a while for drinks to be served. We started off with the burrata and goat cheese appetizers (mom is veggie and she loves cheese), and they were both good, and came out super quickly. A few of us got Caesar salads, and everyone's had the butts of the romaine in it, I personally don't mind them, but my wife and brothers were browning and dirty. For main, everyone got various pastas and meats, veggie flatbread was good, mushroom ravioli was super salty bc of the breadcrumbs, other pastas were decent. I got the lamb, and asked for medium, it came out more of a well done, I didn't mind that too much, but my main gripe was the veggie and sauce, the alcohol in the sauce wasn't cooked off, and since the whole dish was soaked in this sauce, everything including the lamb had that taste. We had a tuxedo cake and tiramisu for dessert, again both decent, tiramisu came out collapsed in a blob, but the flavor wasn't bad. All in all, I'd maybe try again on a weekday, but my main concern was for
The prices the food quality has to be on point. $45 for 3 overcooked double lamb chops covered in some sort tomato sauce with raw alcohol is a little too much.",0,0

2,"Bac is so last year; Ninja City is now where it's at. I had been putting off trying this place because we go to Bac often, and I figured it'd be much of the same food. I was so wrong! Ninja City is much more diverse and catered to a more casual crowd. You won't find much food over $10, but the quality is superb.

Ninja City is done Happy Dog-style with pencil and paper. There are several small bites and entrees to choose from, and you just bubble in what you want on the list. I ordered sweet potato tempura fries and a plate of three pork buns. The pork buns are topped with fresh cilantro and pickeled veggies, as well as some sort of divine spicy mayo. The combination of bbq pork and toppings with the gooey bun is just magic. 

Ninja City has stolen my heart. It has most of my Bac favorites without the oversized portions and inflated prices. They have great specials too, expanding an already awesome list of choices. The service is fast, and there always seems to be plenty of seating even during the busiest hours. It's a great spot for date night or gathering all of your buddies to share a ton of small plates.",1,1
1,"Minerva who took or money was very nice, and our waiter who's name escapes me was also nice. The hostess who seated us was a trainwreck. Agnes, refused to let us sit by the Windows claiming there was no open seats, when there clearly was. In fact the next three groups of people she took all got seated by the Windows. Instead we got seated in quite frankly the worst seats in the house. I was literally sitting in the main aisle right at the entrance/exit to the seating area so it was fun to get bumped into like twenty times. Her claim is that since it was before nine they weren't all the way open. Well if you open at seven you need to let people know you're not going to be ready to work at nine...or make up a better story Agnes. Watched her pull similar crap with several other parties as well. Aside from her basically being rude and nasty, the food had also gone way down in quality since the last time we were here. The ham was good, but easy staples like bacon and eggs were downright nasty. Salad bar accounts for about half of all items. It's not so bad if you can get a seat by the birds and stay awhile and have a few drinks, but I could barely eat seeing as I had to dodge other patrons coming right at me. We just up and left, wasn't worth our time. We had a whole morning/early afternoon planned at flamingo, but decided to go elsewhere after this experience.",0,0

I love pumpkin flavored food and basically anything pumpkin so I was a little disappointed that I couldn't really taste any pumpkin in the pancakes. They seemed like regular pancakes to me with some cinnamon, cloves, etc. 

The service here is very friendly though. Waitress was nice and recommended seasonal items to us. They use some kind of phone app to take orders which is pretty interesting. Since this place is a cafe they have free Wi-fi. I went on a weekday so not sure what the weekend is like but the atmosphere was very calm and quiet.

1,"The Heard museum was very well organized and nicely presented.  I had never been here before today.  The boarding school exhibit was extremely well done and presenting in an interesting manner. 

The reason Alley pup and I visited today was because of the Frida exhibit.  I knew it was small going in but it was small.  I was disappointed that majority of the exhibit were photographs of her.  The photographs were beautiful but I wished I could see more of her paintings.  The paintings were breath taking. 

Furthermore the interactive children's room which focused on Frida and Diego was delightful.  Alley pup wanted to play with all the fun projects and supplies.  There  were also places for Frida selfies. 
The museum did a great job making it enjoyable for everyone.  The main reason for 3 stars is it not affordable.  $7 a person is a but high for families.  Youth need to be able to learn to appreciate art and it seems that they aren't easily given the opportunity.  Make sure to use a culture pass from the library to help make this an affordable experience for all youth.

So I changed my order to the wild Atlantic halibut. About 10 minutes later it arrived and the presentation was strange, with the fish broken up into 3 pieces and hidden on a pile of rice. 

The fish was badly overcooked and was like eating rubber. Since I was already there for a long time, I decided it was best to grin and bear it, pay, and leave. As compensation for steering me wrong the first time they charged me the lower price of my first selection instead of the higher price of my second selection, so they get a bonus star for that.",2,1

4,"You might be surprised...no not really...I hate piano bars. They are right up there with nails on a chalkboard and...oh, yeah...karaoke nights or the ultimate...karaoke only bars. There is nothing worse than forced fun. If you are in a bar and spontaneously sing a song that is playing...great. If it is staged to embarrass people...not so great. So needles to say I arrived with a one star in mind. 

Atmosphere - crowded yet spacious, slightly older crowd, mostly high tables and chairs, two bar locations, center stage w/ large mirror used for writing silly messages. 

Service - prompt and friendly. Never really had to wait for a drink. Went to the bar on the first round and used a server after both w/ equal success. 

Pricing - Similar to other Epicentre establishments ($7 mixed drinks) 

Piano Playing/ Songs - Songs played consisted of your standard sing-alongs of ""Piano Man"", ""American Pie"", ""Tiny Dancer"", and ""Sweet Caroline"". These songs were played with the dueling pianos but as others have mentioned there is support from a drummer and a keyboard player, which is unique to this setting. The musicians will also play requests. Since a majority in attendance w/ me were Steelers fans we got the musicians to play an excellent version of ""Renegade"" by Styx (a Heinz Field staple).  They also played a surprisingly interesting take on Wiz khalifa Steelers theme song ""Black and Yellow"". 

Overall - Despite the fact that I dislike piano bars and the place did not have the same cozy feel that I prefer of say a Mr Smith's in DC, I had a good time. This was mostly due to the company and the musicians willingness to play anything requested...and play it well.",1,1
1,"The hamburgers are good, but there a re a few places in town that certainly rival and surpass The Works. Certainly The Works has the most selection but many feel to much is just too much confusing and it does take some time to work through a menu that probably could be half the size. To me a hamburger is only as good as the beef and the bun. The burgers here are good, but the bun is nothing to write home about. The fries are average and given the amount you pay for the average burger ($13) you would think that a few more fries would be in order. All ink all not bad, but I have a hard time dishing out $38 for two burgers, fries, and two pops when other establishments offer bigger burgers, better bread, and equally or better fries for under $25 for two.",0,0

This was my first time even trying to sell any type of clothing as normally we just donate. I thought it would be neat to do the resell.

Naaaaaaahhh! Not even close, they should really change the name.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito from here expecting chicken, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese.  Instead, I got rice, cheese, and like 2 table spoons of chicken that tasted old and had plenty of ligaments I had to spit out.  Good thing a ordered one of their mini Carne asada tacos which came with beans and chips on the side.

The inside is dirty and the tables were filthy.  The workers seemed like they didn't wanna be there and had a face on them like someone just stole their sombrero.

3,"I should preface this with the fact that I very rarely write poor reviews for places. I like to give establishments the benefit of the doubt. But the treatment I received here was so outrageously bad that I feel the need to write about it. 

My sister came here with a group of her friends and I for her 28th birthday on a Saturday night. We sat on the main floor outdoor patio. 

It was a party of about 15. After a few hours of ordering a lot of food and a few drinks, we were informed that we were cut off. We didn't understand why. None of us were drunk, and none of us were acting rowdy whatsoever. Most people in our party didn't even drink, and the ones that did only had a couple of drinks or so with their food. To this day, we still have no idea what prompted them to kick us out and cut us off. A little explanation would have been appreciated. (I should note that a majority of the people in the party are 28+ with children. Not a boisterous bunch.) Surely, if we were unaware of one of our party's drunken behavior or something of that ilk, we would have apologized. But no explanation was given to us. 

We asked the waitress and the manager why we had been cut off, and neither one offered an explanation, only that we were to settle our bills and leave. 

We were all overcharged on our bills for things we did not order. For example: a friend of mine ordered one jägerbomb and two shots of tequila to toast the birthday girl. She was charged for three jägerbombs. When she went to correct the waitress about it, the waitress said all shots were a flat fee, except on the bill, it was broken down into the shot, plus $4 for the Red Bull (each.) Another person in our party who had covered a couple of other shots of alcohol was charged substantially less for their lone shots. So basically we were lied to in order to get more money from our party. 

When a few us began to complain about being overcharged, we were informed that we should settle up quickly and leave without causing any trouble, and they sent two security guards to watch over our table until we left. We were all obviously very unsettled, upset, and confused about such drastic measures being taken and the way we were being treated. But we all paid our bills in (overcharged) full and left, in order to avoid any problems, and partly out of just general frustration. 

I should also mention that there was only one waitress covering the entire downstairs patio, and not once did she write down any of our orders, not even when people from different parties had made several orders each. I'm surprised she even got half of people's bills correct. 

Plus, the white wine Sangrias they were advertising and serving that night were only a tiny bit of white wine, and mostly orange juice (no sparkling/soda water, no fruits, etc.)

Subpar and frankly outright rude service. Ruined my little sister's birthday. Very disappointing.",0,0

When we got there we were promptly greeted and shown to our table and our server quickly arrived to take our drink order and go over the add on options to the brunch buffet. The brunch buffet is $25 a person and you can add a protein like filet or salmon for an additional $10. They also offer bottomless mimosas  which in my opinion the ratio of juice to champagne  was in favor of the juice. Perhaps some people like that but not this guy! The buffet was not ready in time for our seating we had to wait for a few minutes not s big deal but I thought the jazz musician would have been playing but that didn't happen until
Almost an hour later when we were ready to leave. The buffet was made up of a large variety of desserts and pastries and was very limited on hot items.

I felt like they should of had a few more hot items not that I was expecting a grande buffet spread but I was unimpressed by the variety as there were only six hot items one of which were sausage gravy for the biscuits. don't eat pork or red meat so three hot item eliminated right away. I didn't care for the lobster Mac and cheese and to be fair I'm a hard sell for that fare. I also don't like my eggs on the wet side. It just really didn't seem like a good option or value for me.

I got a Nutella milkshake and we each got a burger. We both like ours cooked medium and the waitress explained that they do a ""true medium"" meaning that the burgers will be very pink in the middle. We got different toppings to go with our burgers and the wait began. 

The milkshake came out almost right away. It was delicious. I could really taste the Nutella. We waited what I felt was a very reasonable time for our burgers. When they finally arrived, there were a few things wrong with our burgers. It was missing cheese and all the condiments were switched around. We decided not to be pests and just ate what was in front of us. 

The burgers were, indeed, a true medium which was very good. I felt that the burger size was rather small from the 1/2 pound burger that was promised.

In addition to the chinese buffet there is also a shushi bar and mongolian BBQ.  I am a chicken eater so I will only review the chicken, veggie dishes and desserts, but I will comment on the presentation.

There was a lady preparing the sushi and the ingredients did not look very fresh. I have had mongolian BBQ and for the life of me I was unable to determine what the meats were. They were mystery meats and I stopped looking before it ruined my appetite.

Now for the standard buffet. Most items were labeled but some were not so choose with care. Hot and sour soup had a nice flavor but I thought it was little salty. The chicken dishes were tasty. I tried the green beans and while they were tasty they were very oily. Lo Mein had a nice flavor, the rice noodle dish was very oily and lacking flavor. The spring rolls tasted like cardboard. Fried rice was mildly seasoned and had some flavor. Sesame chicken and Tso's chicken were very similar in flavor but tasty. Kung Po was very mild. Chicken and broccoli was tasty. The sweet baked deserts were awful and I couldn't really even finish one. The ice cream was ok.

Almost every restaurant has good and bad dishes. This place is no exception. It is standard chinese food and edible. Same type food you get almost everywhere else but all in a single buffet. You can get some tasty food but you not will not like everything. I would go back again as there was enough variety to eat.

Good? Yes. Great? No..",0,0
0,"Good veggie option- except that they served me the soup with chicken so I had to send it back. Perhaps they thought that chicken must be vegetarian.. :)

3,"Pros: Nice space & service. Great location.

Cons: Not my 1st choice, but all the really good places in this nabe (and some of the soso ones) don't take reservations, and can't seat a group of 8 or more at the last minute/day of.... so my pals and I ended up here. Nice but nothing blew our socks off, but maybe that is because we're all spoiled rotten and do a lot of travelling? Big surprise was that even after 3 courses & wine (total into 4 digits for sure) when we mentioned that the 4 orders of bread pudding they sent to table were all cold, they sent out a round of nearly undrinkable port and proceeded to CHARGE US THE FULL PRICE of all these desserts, even though the kitchen made an error. Comping us the desserts would have cost them less than 5% of our bill but instead, they've lost 8 people as customers... interesting business approach.

For the price, there are a lot better choices in the city, and in the 'nabe.",0,1

8,"This place is straight up amazing. Must try.  

It's laid back, casual. They actually reserve seats, but it's very similar to a food court type of feel. You'll think you're in Asia.

Most first time visitors try their Kamayan feast. It's $15 a person, for a literal pile of food. Garlic rice, roast pork, skewers, fish, squid etc. It doesn't look like a lot, but it's a lot. I'm not a small eater by any means, and I barely finished. Judge portions accordingly... I would even recommend 3 portions for 4 people if some are smaller eaters. 

Big tip: They have a sauce section. This is where I discovered banana sauce. Why the heck is banana sauce red?! But this thing is delicious. Girlfriend practically soaked everything in this amazing dyed banana substance. It's the same sauce on the pork skewer. 

Big tip #2: Make. Reservations. 100%. You will not find a seat even at 6pm on a Friday.

Big tip #3: Their hand wash station is behind the payment counter. You get to walk into their kitchen and see their operations. I feel like it might violate SOME SORT of health and safety... but it didn't bother me. In fact, it was very interesting!

Absolute must try for an awesome, inexpensive food experience.",5,2

So it just depends on what you are looking for. The staff was nice over all. Was diss appointed in the Vietnamese coffee it came in a regular mug and I was hoping to get it in a toilet mug.

0,"Not surprised to see another Korean run Japanese restaurant in this area. This one, however, is severely understaffed or was when I came in for dinner on Saturday. We sat there waiting for the menu for over 15 minutes, there were customers impatiently waiting for the bill and their food (there seems to be only one sushi chef behind the bar and one very stressed out waitress).

I ordered the Chirashi dinner ($17.95) - The presentation was nice but the sashimi pieces were dry. The rice were a bit overcooked and there was way too much radish to make the plate look fuller. 

We also tried the Legend Dragon Roll ($14.95) and it was pretty good!  I really like the combo of soft shell crab, unagi and deep fries kani. I wished I tried out more specialty makis instead of my Chirashi but the sushi here is on the pricier side. 

If the sashimi was fresh, I might come back.. But unfortunately the service did not impress either.",0,0

0,"I started going to Desert Nail Spa a little over a year ago & absolutely love their SNS dip powder manicures! April is wonderful and always does a great job! They aren't too thick and always look beautiful! 5 stars.

I changed my review to 1 star because although I've only had one bad experience over the past year, it was a terrible one. I went to get a SNS manicure on a day that April was not working so I saw a woman name Vivian. I went with my maid of honor to get my nails done for my wedding assuming that everyone was as good as April is. Vivian did a very thin white tip and only did one layer of power on my French manicure which made it look like I was not even wearing anything on my nails. When I asked her to do a second layer and/or make the white tip thicker as I have very long bail beds, Vivian was extremely rude to me. She was so rude to the point that I decided that I would come back another day when April was working as she always does a beautiful job and after all, these were my wedding nails. After I asked Vivian to removed the one layer she had done, she nicked my skin multiple times (it felt like it was on purpose) while taking off my dip powder with her electric tool. I told her that she was burning my nails and that it was hurting in which she replied ""it's going to hurt you took it off twice."" There is absolutely no reason she should have nicked my fingers or that it should have burned no matter how many times you removed the polish. I am absolutely astounded at how unprofessional she was and how inappropriate this experience was. I attempted to tell someone at the front desk about my experience and they just replied with ""we already know it's in the notes"" when in fact they didn't know. They only know what Vivian had told them, not my side of the story. Therefore, I am writing this review. So disappointed in this terrible experience.

Thankfully, I was able to make an appointment the next day with April prior to my rehearsal and she did an amazing job as always.",0,0

It was the only thing I ate that afternoon before flying home. When I got off the plane I was deathly ill and vomited violently the rest of the night.

1,"I dropped off my car at Toyota 8:15 a.m. and told the service rep that I would be coming back to pick up my car at about 11:00 or 11:30 AM.

When I arrived Toyota at 11:45 AM (just before noon), I noticed my car sitting in the outgoing driveway with the driver window down, engine running, and air conditioning running. It had been running since 9:08 a.m. (when the service advisor called me, but it was a missed call and I didn't know who it was so I didn't call that number back) until 11:45.

I checked my gas gauge and it had gone down ¼ tank. I came in with a full tank of gas. I was pissed and went inside to talk to the service manager. I explained the situation and he immediately apologized and offered to fill my tank. My 25,000 mile service was $39.95 but he waived those charges because of what happened. I thought that was fair. But I did ask him to talk to his people about leaving a customer's engine running the entire time before they pick it up. My car had been idling for almost 3 hours in the outgoing driveway!

This is the second time it's happened. The first time I let it go, didn't say anything and just went home. But the second time, I was really upset.

To their credit, Toyota took care of the problem: They re-filled my gas tank and waived the service charges. Their service advisor and service manager were both professional, apologetic, and wanted to make things right with their customer.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning around 10:30 it took a couple of minutes to acknowledge us before someone greeted us and offered to seat us. The outdoor patio looked really cute but there was not an open table so we choose inside. We looked over the lunch menus and sat for several minutes before being greeted. We order water and my husband asked about breakfast. He was brought a breakfast menu to look at. A few more minutes passed and we ordered our food and was brought a basket of chips and two salsas. The chips were slightly warm and had good flavor. The salsa was ok at best. After 10 or so minutes we were checked on and we asked for more water. Our food took about 20 minutes to get. We were seated outside the kitchen and it sounded a bit unorganized. We were brought our food and then left. Husband had pancakes and strawberries which he said was pretty good. Ordered a crab relleno  with rice and beans. The releno  was small but not greasy like most. Inside was just lots of imitation crab. The rice and beans were okay but nothing special.

0,"Quick tips incoming!

1. This buffet is located in the center of the gaming floor in the Bellagio casino.

2. The line appears to move much more quickly than that of other buffets. So don't fret about a long line! Realistically it's a pretty short wait when compared to Bacchanal.

3. On the little island area next to the bar, there are several made to order dishes. You must ask a person to make you what is behind the counter! Don't hesitate to ask.

One thing about this buffet, that seems to have happened to my girlfriend and me was the fact that every time we went it felt like we were getting diminishing returns on our enjoyment of this place.

First off, I must say that if Yelp were to allow us to rate their level of service and the food, I would almost give it five stars. There have been some problems when we pay for our buffet from pretty shoddy and downright awful service. What I mean by this is, on a few occasions, the people who were taking our money were absolutely impolite. One time, we tried to charge our room at a different MGM resort. However, the lady taking the money was not having it since the system was not really working properly. She angrily told us to pay with a credit card or with cash or get out. 

Anyways, besides service problems at intake, the servers and bussers in the buffet area are always top notch. I have never had to complain about a server. They are incredibly efficient and thoughtful with your needs.

The second thing, that results in such a low rating then is that the food just isn't as good as it is every time we go. Like I said about diminishing returns, it seems that every time we go to the buffet the food gets worse and worse and more and more unappetizing. For example, we LOVED their prime rib. We couldn't stop raving about how awesome it was all the way home and to our friends. However, after our last few trips, we were so disappointed by the quality and dryness of the meat.

As for the desserts, it feels like the Bellagio is caught in some sort of timewarp. They are still trapped in the early 2000s where soft-serve ice cream is the norm for most buffets. I don't know why they haven't updated to gelato or at least scoopable ice cream.

Anyways, the Bellagio Buffet is still an iconic part of the Vegas strip! You should still try it out to see if you like it. Happy eating! :)",0,0

After recently moving from Minnesota to Arizona, I am happy to have found that the employees at this location are as friendly as the ones in the mid-west.

1,"I took my son here to buy his first car. He found a car he liked and salesman took us in the office to go over some numbers. They gave us a $500 discount off the price. When I asked for more , he brought the sale manager (I think his name is Kevin).  The sale manager ensured us we are getting the best deal in town. We proceed to go over down payment and monthly payment.  This is where we have problems.  My son said he have 3k to put down and want payments to be under $400/monthly.  We were then told this can not be done without a co signer.  Since my son is 20 years old and a 1st time buyer he would need a co signer.  The vehicle was a 2016 Ford mustang with 45k miles and priced at 18,500. My son did not want a cosigner.  The manager didn't even tried to preapproved without a cosigner.

The food took quite some time to come out but it was tasty and was a large serving of food. The price matched the dish which was a plus. 
For desert, we brought a cake that the restaurant was nice enough to place in their refrigerator. However, once the cake was brought out we were not provided plates or silverware (since our main course was through we no longer had silverware). We had to get up and ask for plates forks, etc.

The ribeye's which they charge $38 for was not even worth $10.  The last time we were here a medium rare ribeye was very juicy and tender, last night it was dry, hard and a very bad cut of meat.  

My wife's was so bad she sent it back.  The manager came over and apologized saying she did not know if maybe it was the vendor did not have exactly what they ordered this time or what happened.  She did apologize and took the ribeye off our bill and told my wife she would also comp dessert or another drink for here.  She said she did not want the dessert but would have another drink.  Guess what $12 charge for the drink, no comp???

A big deal, NO not really, just another sign of a great place going down hill.  I am not sure what happened to the quality of the meat they use, but the ribeye I had was nothing like the last time.  Also, when someone tells you they will do something, they should make sure it happens.  

Our server was new only been there a few months, but the entire feel of attention to detail and service was so different then the last visit we had.  It is sad to say this place will now be off our list of good places to visit.

On my most recent visit we waited 5 minutes for the host to even appear at the front desk. After we were seated someone brought us waters and it was 15 minutes until we tracked down a waiter to help us. 

I observed the manager walking aimlessly around the restaurant ignoring the fact he had 1 waiter working every table inside and that his host kept walking to the back patio to fraternize which at one point caused a couple to give up waiting at the front desk and leave. 

This experience isn't representative of every time I've been here but it is never much better.

3,"I couponed for awhile. Then I stopped because I didn't grocery shop as much I wanted to because prices seemed to be going on up and only bought what we needed vs. stockpiling (what we used to do). 

BUT...with my one visit to Winco a few days ago, I have now bookmarked a bunch of the most popular coupon websites and will now coupon as much as I can and only buy my stuff at Winco. I noticed that some of the other Yelpers thought that the prices weren't that great, but I must disagree. I've shopped Food 4 Less, Albertson's, Vons, Wal-Mart and Smiths. I'm a card carrying remember to all these places and take advantage of their great promos and sales (when they have them), but those are rare. For example, without a coupon and their normal pricing, the spaghetti sauce I normally buy was $1.25 (give or take a few cents, I forget) but even at Wal-Mart, this sauce is usually about $2.50. My baby's diapers were cheaper here (broke down to .14 cents a diaper, no coupon. Even with a coupon at other places, the average cost per diaper is still .20 cents). Bacon was $1.98 (yes I used a coupon, but regular price is normally about $3.00 - at Wal-Mart, it's about $4 and some change). The prices are definitey close to 20-30% cheaper than your neighborhood grocery store chain. 

Winco does take coupons, but they don't double, triple and googleidererdiple like the extreme couponers do...or stack coupons. Winco also only takes debit or cash and you bag your own groceries like a Food 4 Less. 

If you don't live by one, I suggest trying out this place at least once to see if it's your cup of tea. Maybe wait till all the hoopla dies down. I went at 9:30am on a Friday morning and I had to practically park at RC Willey to go here. If you are on a budget, and want to be on an extreme budget, this is probably your best place to go in Vegas.

We arrived shortly before 6 p.m. and were promptly seated on the patio. The inside dining area was already pretty busy with happy hour. Our server was polite and was more than happy to explain what was on the happy hour menu. 
We ordered two pints and the sausage and peppers to start. Unfortunately, those were the only real highlights of the meal. The flavors of the sausage and peppers were great. It had some heat without being overwhelming. I did feel the dish was a little small for the $10 non-happy hour price point.
Next was our salads - the mista. We ordered a large to split and the kitchen was kind enough to split in onto two separate plates without us asking. The salad was just waaaaay too over-dressed. The dressing was tossed on and the whole thing was just drenched. I know some people like this, but it just wasn't for me.
We also split the brussel sprouts pizza. From the menu description, I imagined the brussel sprouts would have been sliced and then oven roasted. They were actually just a handful of leaves that had been lightly steamed before being placed on top of the pizza. They added zero taste and wouldn't even stay on the pizza. The cheese, pancetta and caramelized onion were good, but the brussel sprouts just seemed out of place in comparison. The pizza crust was the biggest disappointment of all. It was completely bland. No seasoning, no taste, no anything. It honestly reminded me of a pretzel without the salt. 
Ultimately, there's nothing wrong with this place. The outside seating is nice and they have a good happy hour. The food just wasn't compelling enough to make me want come back in the future.",1,1
0,"I was treated very well on my recent visit.  The doctor and staff were knowledgeable and caring.  I was impressed with the fact that they were able to use my current frames for my new prescription.  I was more impressed that they were able to do this within less than an hour, as they are progressive lens'.  The last time I had progressive lens' done at a different place, the glasses had to be ""sent out"" and I had to wait about a week.  I was thrilled to leave there being able to SEE :)",0,1
0,"So I'm not usually someone who writes reviews ... Just one of those who goes by what everyone else says. But I had such a great BD dinner celebration with my husband that I said it's time to post a review. Unlike others we wanted to take our time during dinner and told the waiter such. He was great, checked back several times to make sure everything was ok. We had grapefruit margaritas, yum. We each ordered the BLT salad which we could have split. Entrees were nice portions I had the special grilled trout that came with asparagus.

I mentioned to my husband no dessert. Hate when the waiters come sing Happy BD. But he mentioned to the waiter we'd like 1 scoop of sorbet on his way to the restroom (sneaky). To our surprise they brought a huge dish of 3 scoops of mango sorbet with 2 cookies and HB written in chocolate and a lit candle to boot. Yay no HB singing just made a quiet wish.  To top it off the waiter said the desserts on us :-)",0,0

The issue was when we were finishing our drinks and about to close out and I saw a RAT crawling on the wall and then in the ceiling .

3,"On the plus side, they do know how to play the role of a bad car salesman. I test drove a CX-5. The test drive was fine. However, the salesperson selectively omitted a few things, like the differences between the 2017 and 2018 versions. But that I expect. What was unbelievable was I emailed the guy to see if I could get a lower price. I cited a couple of comparable cars that I was looking at. I get an email from the general manager saying, ""No thank you. I find your offer shocking and here is real data to prove why...Thank you for your time."" Wow. Who knew car dealers would be so insulted by an attempt to negotiate.",0,0

Marina said she wasn't licensed so take that up with her!!!  showed up late and she didn't want to work.  As for anyone who has cancer you are acidic and therefore have more lactic acid build up then your average person.  How do you help that?  MASSAGE!!  How do you move your lymph system?  MASSAGE!!  You don't need any specific type!!  You don't need someone trained in oncology!  This is not dangerous to a cancer patient!  This is hilarious to me.  I also had my doctors permission as well!  Your girl was rude I waited outside she didn't want to be there and had an attitude!  I don't have tumors etc it was a blood cancer. You stressed me out in a fragile state as I waited 30min for a rude person to show up and make me feel awful!!  Please educate yourself and have better customer service if you plan on running a business. I'm a very young girl and that was my only health problem. I had a massage two weeks prior in Scottsdale with no problems and it was a beautiful place not a crap shoot that isn't going to value you as a person.  Say what you want but she was late, rude and Un-compassionate and happy she had a way out of not doing  my massage!!  Please educate yourself.

6,"The five star reviews are for the most part right on point. My decision to pick Water Heater Pros out of the 2 others I was considering  were based  mostly on Yelp reviews from reliable Elite Yelpers I knew.
  
Mr. B. noticed our 13 year old water heater starting to leak and asked me to find someone for him to replace and install a water heater. After researching, we called Water Pros, which gave us a quote on the phone for a new water heater plus installation.  It was pretty reasonable.  So the appointment was made for the next morning for them to come out.

Our installer showed up the next morning. Shane was very courteous and friendly.  Explained what needed to be done, also said he would clean up the area and also haul off our old water heater.  It took approx 45 minutes for the the whole process. He did the work as promised, there was no upselling, unexpected charges and we were charged the quoted price. In fact, there was a Yelp deal, but I chose to use the $25 off coupon I found on their website instead.
  
We're very much satisfied by the installation work done on our new water heater by these guys. In fact the water heater they installed was more energy efficient than our original one!  I feel I made the right choice and we are very pleased with Water Heater Pros. I would definitely  recommend them!",1,1

3,"Finding hidden gems like SoHo Japanese Restaurant is why I love yelp!  I was scanning through the typical Vegas tourist spots for dinner when I came across SoHo.  Seeing a restaurant with over 350 reviews and a perfect 5 star score is a rarity so I knew I had to investigate further.  The restaurant is located about 5 miles off the Las Vegas strip, I believe the cab ride cost around $17 coming from Mandalay Bay.  It was well worth the drive! 

When we arrived it happened to be happy hour and SoHo has some GREAT Happy Hour Specials.  Everything is absolutely fantastic and fantastically priced!!

Among some of the standouts and must orders if you visit: 

Black Cod Happy Hour Special is a must try, you might even order 2 
Ahi Poki Tostada Happy Hour Special: you will definitely order 2
Yellow Fin with jalapeño - Fantastically delicious  
Golden Trout with Pop rocks (yep, pop rocks!)
Angus Beef Tataki - tastes as good as it looks
Soft Shell Crab Special - breaded and fried, served with three amazing dipping sauces.  If it's available (seasonal) get it!  
Bone in Short Rib - fell right off the bone.  Moist, tender and totally delicious.

Green Tea Crème Brûlée to finish off the meal - no words left to describe this except a heavenly finish to an outstanding meal.  

So now that I've listed almost the entire menu as ""must try"" I hope you understand the level of enthusiasm I have for this restaurant and it's food.  To add to the experience Chef John, owner and executive chef, came by to visit our table.  It was instantly apparent his love for what he does and his appreciation for good food.  His message to us was he wanted to take the Vegas dining experience off the strip and bring it to where the locals can enjoy.  I hope he plans to expand to Washington, DC!!!",0,1

26,"First I want to say that I appreciate every flight that takes off and lands successfully. That criteria will always result in 3 stars from me. But... United really needs to work on customer satisfaction. I don't appreciate spending hundreds on a ticket and then handing over more money to check my first bag. I also don't love it when they delay my flight by an hour and a half and then change the gate we are landing at from 72 to 134 when I need to catch a connection at gate 70 in five minutes after getting off the first plane. Fortunately, my husband was able to run past 60 gates to get them to hold the flight. Not really customer focused any more, but as I said, 3 stars for a smooth take off and landing. I'll be tempted to try other airlines moving forward because I think customer service should be first right behind safety.",17,11

The spicy marriage cold dish was delicious, with ample cilantro which I love. I also liked the beef pancake rolls, but it tasted similar to other restaurants so wasn't that big of a stand out. The braised beef noodles was my least favourite - it looked good in other people's pictures but my order came with only tendon-y/skin portions, which was awful.

5,"I always like the Star nursery on Charleston, but relocation has brought me to the south side of town, and this Eastern location is the largest over here. They have a nice selection of pretty much everything you need from irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, mulch and rock, and of course plants. 

The items I needed were priced higher than if I got them at Lowe's. An 1 1/2"" slip fix was almost $1.25 higher. Normally I will purchase through a vendor but this was a ""need right now"" part. Vendor price is $2.27 cheaper. That's a big markup on a $8 part. 

The store itself is fairly clean and well organised. There is cheap labor hanging around out front as usual. The parking lot is large, plenty of room for big trucks. 

They had all the varieties of plants I was looking for my project. Wintertime isn't the best time to view some varieties as they only look like sticks. I'll need to order directly from a nursery to insure the instant ""look"" that I need. This is a retail store, and convenient, but if you have a large project I always suggest going straight to a nursery that specializes in the plants you seek to get better pricing. Sadly in Nevada most of those nurseries are located in California. 

Star does support our local economy and horticultural programs, as well as has educational in-store programs and demonstrations. The people that work there often have a wealth of knowledge, and can answer most of your questions.",4,3

No flavor to the sauce, too many bell peppers, too few pieces of chicken which tasted as if they'd been cooked separate from the sauce. Masala chai was flavorless super hot milk.

I had the roasted shrimp and grits. The grits were the best I have ever had (sorry North Carolina!). The shrimp portion was amazing. The dessert was great. I was surprised to see the offering of huckleberries. 

Sadly, the server forgot quite a bit of things. My client's wife ordered a second glass of wine to have for dinner, which was forgotten.

There is a dining area, which is dark and uninspiring, although clean and in good repair.  There is a large bar area which is noisy, even on on off day, and the noise cascades through the dining room.

1,"This was my first visit. I was looking to get my hair a balayage, and I was quite picky with which salon I decided to go to. I came home for the weekend and after reviewing salons, this seemed like a decent place. 
I had Laura, who was friendly. I showed her pictures of what I liked and although the outcome was a lot more blonde then I had hoped, I still liked it. The next day I noticed after my curls had fallen out, that the transition was not exactly what I had hoped.  It looked quite blocky and not well blended, so I called back the next day. The receptionist notified me I would have to talk to the stylist, so I did. I already paid $300 at this point which is a lot for me considering I'm a student, and I never have spent that much on my hair. So realizing I wasn't quite satisfied didn't make me feel the greatest. She told me that I would still need to pay, depending on what she had to correct. She said she might have to tone it, which I should bring $10, but if she needed to use bleach it would have to be more. My original salon I went to would never charge new clients to correct things and I would have gone back there if I wasn't in such a rush to get my hair done. That is bad customer service in my opinion. That is how you get returning customers, by welcoming them back by fixing something they are not happy with. Definitely won't be coming here again and I have many friends/family who live in the Vaughn area which now know about this as well.

The bags are concerning. They collect bacteria and debris from people's feet, even if the blue stuff is put in at every use. My mom was with us and had a shaving nik on her ankle. The day after this visit, she woke up with it infected. Makes me wonder about the the cleanliness of those foot tubs. I do not know the proper techniques for sanitizing the foot tubs, but reusing bags probably isn't the way to go. I think they should be changing those bags after each use. I do know that they are disposable. 

The place is large and clean otherwise. The tools used were from a sanitized pack. The tech was good and thorough, though she kept getting up to go survey the work of another gal doing a full set at the desks. That got a little annoying. There was always someone cleaning or sweeping. They are setup to host a lot of people at once, but call ahead if you do. We called for three of us and good thing too.

Thanks to one of my friends' extended knowledge, we decided to grab ramen in Chinatown at her favorite place, Monta. The shop isn't particularly big and I guess people heard about the hype so there can be a 20-40 minute wait a lot of the time. 

I got the tonkatsu ramen and the base price is such a great deal at just $6.75. I added corn for $1 extra and my friend and I also shared the fried rice. You also have to purchase green tea and it comes hot in a can (so interesting). Still, after all that, our total was $32 after tax which is such a great deal!

Let me just say, this place is amazing! My husband loved it, my kids loved it, and I loved it. The suite was clean, spacious and had all the comforts of home. Dishwasher,  washer, range, fridge, microwave and a full size washer and dryer.

The kitchen came in handy for late night munchies and breakfast. It came stocked with dishes, a coffee machine and a toaster. There is a restaurant on site, and a mini market/gift shop.

Check-in and check out were a breeze. There are shuttles that will take you to and from the strip at designated times. Make sure you are on time, otherwise you'll miss the shuttle. Some places need a 24 hour reservation in order to ride to, so be sure you call ahead. If you can walk it takes about 5-10 minutes to walk across the street to the strip. We only used the shuttle when we were exhausted. 

The staff were all kind,friendly, attentative  and extremely helpful.

0,"This is an interesting place, for sure.

Located at the lobby of a hotel, it feels like you're traveling (not necessary on vacation).

It feels kind of empty and the traffic of people makes it feel more awkward. 

The service was OK and so was the food. Nothing impressive.

It seems that the butter has sugar in it or something. The mushrooms tasted sweet and so did the mash potatoes. Not my cup of tea.

The shrimp cocktail was good but nothing impressive. The shrimp weren't as large as in other places but the serving was 5 pieces. They also use a small flat plate with the sauce on the side which kills the glamour of this dish (from my point of view).

The 7oz filet that I ordered was cooked the way I ordered, so that gives this place the 3rd star. 

I didn't pay so I'm not sure about the ratio price-quality.

It's OK if you're in the area but nothing to remember.

I usually try to go to Hobby Lobby or Michaels, but sometimes I don't feel like driving the extra miles, however, once I am in that line from hell, I wish I was driving to the other store.  On top of everything, most of the items are 20% to 30% more expensive than HL.  Also, you have to make a line to get a piece of fabric cut, during busy times you have to take a number, which should be used all the time, because there are people who will cut in front of you if there is no number calling that day.

I went with 3 of my close girlfriends so we decided to each order a different item for our Lunch Prix Meal. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything off the menu :) Starters were good. The tomato gazpacho was smooth and the peppered squid was texturized well adding that crunch. For the main entrees, the poached salmon and the grilled chicken were amazing. They were both moist and packed full of flavour. I was blown away by the peas fricassee that accompanied the chicken because it gave it that extra flavour booster. Desserts were good so no complaint there. The chocolate praline pyramid was very rich and soo yummy while the panna cotta gave that refreshing and smooth taste. 

The only thing I didn't enjoy from the meal was their mushroom and quinoa risotto. It wasn't the typical creamy risotto I was used to. This was more like eating couscous and it was very bland and dry. Hard to swallow at times as well since it was like downing on pebbles.

No problem, we just need our room so we can get our infant settled. The manager then walks away. She wasn't friendly at all and I was trying to be nice. Then the desk clerk took our card for payment and tried charging an extra $200. I showed her the email again and asked her to correct the total payment amount.

2,"That whole roast pork hanging  at Prince BBQ sure looked good.... 

It just looked so massive, crispy, meaty and fatty .... we just could not resist the temptation to order some to give it a try.

The skin I think is the best part of the whole pig, while my other friends were eating all those meaty fatty part I picked all the skin and crunched that in my mouth when they were not watching....

The meat part though I found it a little too mushy... but still really good as it was still warm and fresh!!",1,1
0,"I've been a member for almost 1 year now and feel comfortable leaving a review of the services.  The facility itself is very professional, simple and well decorated.  The rooms are very calming, clean and quiet.  The therapists themselves are very varied in their techniques and skill levels.  I have tried 5 different therapists before finally finding one who is AMAZING.  The first therapist I had was TERRIBLE and I felt like i wasted my money.  The good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  The other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  I enjoy high pressure deep tissue massages and I finally found an amazing therapist who I exclusively book appointments with.

I had a couple of negative experiences where I got 2 eye stys immediately after my massage.  I noticed on both occasions that there was residue black eye makeup on the face towel where I lay my head.  I don't know if the face towel was reused but I also understand that mascara and eyeliner don't wash out of white towels so I just assumed that the towels were fresh at the time.  I also did not request to have them changed because I didn't want to be rude so that was my mistake and I can't prove that the towels were reused so I won't fault them for that.  

In summary, if you have signed up for a membership then take the time to really try different therapists and find the one that is right for you. The staff are very polite and professional.  The value is great if you go for regular massages but only if you have a great therapist.",0,0

1,"3.5 stars, for sure

Stopped in here with my son for a quick lunch yesterday.  

Location is convenient and close (ish).  The restaurant was clean and service was quick and friendly.

Kiddo and I shared edamame, seaweed salad, nigiri, one specialty  roll, and a side of steamed rice.  The edamame and seaweed salad were fine--can't do much wrong with those.  We shared ikura nigiri (gunkan) and I had an order of hamachi nigiri.  The ikura wasn't the freshest, but still fine.  The hamachi was good quality.  The cut wasn't the best, but it still tasted good.  The only problem I had was the sushi rice.  Not the rice itself but that it wasn't packed enough and it fell apart when I picked it up.  No biggie.  The roll we had was the summer roll--crab and avo inside, mango outside, sweet chile sauce.  It was just ok.

The price was reasonable--$37 for lunch for 1.5 and we were totally stuffed.  I will probably make another trip to Fusion to try some Chinese.  I would also try the sushi again, but not a specialty roll.",0,1

And it began pouring rain around the 45th minute. I'd left my sun roof open as it was SUNNY thinking it would take TEN MINUTES so I had to run outside in the pouring rain to close it. So Now I sit drenched in water in a soaked seat in my car because 3 Fedex employees need to learn basic COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

1,"Is there a NEGATIVE STAR? I'm not new to renting cars! Is Budget Rental a FRANCHISE?
We had an issue with the rental agent at the Las Vegas Airport facility. We had a confirmed reservation, just ready to pick up our car and go! To my dismay... we had the sales pitch of the day. I don't mind him suggesting other options that Budget may offer, what ""irritated"" me was he was annoying! He lacked listening skills!! You know, talk, pause, listen, advise, communicate etc... He must have loved the sound of his own voice he forgot there was customers in front of him! He did not try to listen to what we needed!! He constantly talked over us especially to my husband,,, (my husband is a patient man,,, I wanted to yell at him but I kept quiet) then had the nerve to rush us and be impatient with us! SERIOUSLY DUDE? He was like a car salesman trying to sell a vehicle!!! He got us to purchase the extra cost for gas .. which annoyed me.. because... he kept referencing and guaranteeing the price of gas in Los Angeles instead of being humble by saying ""probably"" or ""maybe"" that it cost $$ this much etc. Last I checked this was BUDGET RENT A CAR and not gasbuddy.com to be so bold on referencing gas prices! In the end ...because of his behavior,,, we felt that we did not have time to think things through regarding the vehicle/final agreement and felt we ended up paying more than we budgeted for! Just be aware of these types of agents, and don't allow anyone to bully you into signing up for something you don't want/need. On a positive note, I did file a complaint with Budget and they assured me that a copy of my complaint, along with the details of my report will be addressed to their management team.",1,1

3,"So I don't usually go to a new restaurant until they've been open for a couple of weeks. Under the recommendation from an old high school buddy we went for lunch on the FIRST DAY. We started out with a Corona and a House Margarita. The beer was cold and the Margarita just right. We ordered the table side Guacamole. The Guacamole Star came over and explained everything that was going in it. She did a great job but unfortunately this was the disappointment of the meal. The avocados, although soft, were not quite ripe and tasted green. It definitely needed more salt and lime juice. There was just NO PUNCH to it. Not sure if we'll order that again. My wife ordered the Chicken Tacos and I ordered the Duck Tacos (the food I was looking forward to).  Unfortunately they had run out during the soft opening and the fresh duck had come in that morning and was not ready yet.  Having been in and out of the restaurant business a large part if my life I find no excuse in running out or regular menu items..... specials yes, not regular menu items. I ordered the Blackened Redfish Tacos, Rice & Beans and Street Corn. We were told that the food would come out in waves, which was fine. My wife got her Chicken Tacos, the the two sides and my Tacos came out. The sides were steaming hot and full of flavor. The small orders were enough for both of us. My wife's Chicken Tacos were perfectly cooked and the slaw and sauce were full of flavors. It was nice to find a restaurant that understands that BLACKENED means covering the protein completely with spices not just sprinkled! The freshly made Blue Corn Tacos were just perfect. The service from the Hostess to the person who took our drink orders...our server, Guacamole Star even the food runner were all amazing. The noise level was quite intense and the restaurant was only about three quarters full. Some Acoustic Dampeners would go a long way. Finally, read where someone complained about the size and price of the Tacos, there is truly no problem there!

The cold-case is filled with a variety of salads - zucchini, greek, bean, and a very tasty sweet potato salad with a nice crunch from green onions. The small size was a decent amount for a light lunch. Sandwich staples like ham and swiss are also balanced out with more interesting ones like jerk chicken w/mango salsa.

The shelves are stocked with gourmet goods and house-made sauces. In particular, the hot sauces look intriguing. Also spied: Jerk rubs, peppercorn marinade, and apple ginger sauce, to name a few.

The Irish Nachos, a decadent pile of potato chips, jalapeños, and kidney beans, are a great food for soaking up some of the tasty on-draft beers offered, including Harp and Goose Island IPA. Our service was a little slow, but considering it was a Friday night, I'd let it slide.

The entrees are not huge portions, so if you're famished, you might be a little underwhelmed. The shrimp and chips make up for the smaller size in flavor. Sumptuous shrimp in a beer batter? Count me in.

I was not crazy about the musical guest, a guy wearing glasses and an acoustic guitar who thought killing the mood with Van Morrison's ""Into the Mystic"" would be a good idea.

That about sums up the crowd at BS West - at least on 2-4-1 (yep, two for one drinks all night!) Wednesdays - their busiest night.  I'm not a big fan of this place as the crowd is pretty young and obnoxious -- drawing in my least favorite crowds:  gay ASU guys and the Scottsdale/East Valley gays.

Weekends are a bit more subdued, and might be a better time to check BS out, and on Thursdays and Sunday they do some karaoke.  Gays and karaoke?  Who would have thought.

It can be a very fun time if you go with your friends.  There's a nice loungey room upstairs with couches and a pool table (which I'm sure is fun on other days when it's not so crowded).  The music is dance/top 40 with accompanying MTV videos on the big screens.  It gets very busy, and with the north patio doors flung open, it can get downright STEAMY (and not in a good way) in there.

Since the renovation about a year ago they enlarged the dance floor, the unisex bathrooms are larger and much nicer and they added a south patio.  But it's still packed as ever as this is the only gay bar in Scottsdale, the closest gay bar to ASU and the closest one to Mesa.

My arm was about to break and even looking around the store I couldn't see anyone that worked there.

I wear size 14 or 16 depending on the brand or an XL or one X some of the items in their store I had to get in a 2x or 3x because they ran so small. After trying on a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and realizing that they didn't have my size in 90% of the things that I wanted to buy I finally proceeded to locate a customer service rep who then had no interest in helping me. She literally just walked around the plus size section moving things around without even looking at them. I then took the three or four items that I wanted to purchase to the checkout line.

2,"I came here with a fellow yelper as she (Grace L.) told me that it was worth it. And surprisingly, she couldn't believe that I haven't came before. This place is located right next to the Guitar Center, right on Independence Blvd. 

Anyways, lets get to the exciting part: the food. As I just ate at 2:00 and then came here at 5, I was thinking I wasn't going to eat that much. But seeing the menu I had to try out their Kobe Beef burger. Grace's hubby decided to just get appetizers so I had my fair share of their different types of appetizers.

We ordered the restaurant favorite: Bang Bang Shrimp, Crab Cakes, and the fried Calamari. Lets go through them.

Bang Bang Shrimp: Not bad. This I thought was actually the worse appetizer compared to the other 2. The problem of this appetizer was that there was just no flavor to it. It was just fried shrimp, with some kind of sauce and had a hint of spice to it. Almost like they sprinkled it with black pepper and that was it. The sauce, was just bland. Plain and simple. My friend told me that it was usually better than this time, but I guess I'll just have to find out next time.

Crab Cakes: I thought these were delicious. Even though crab cakes are usually pricey and usually no one gets them I thought they were very full and had a good amount of crab in them. The flavor I thought was better than the shrimp. It came with a sauce that went pretty well with it.

Fried Calimari: Not bad. Well, calimari was calimari, nothing crazy special. It came with an Asian sweet dipping sauce, sort of like a sweet and sour sauce, and that was about it. All fried calimari preparations taste the same this way, the only place that I like the calimari prepared is the one they make at Saigon Palace on South Blvd.

Kobe Beef Burger: I sort of killed this dish, just because I thought it was the dish of the night for me. It was big and full of flavor. The beef had a sort of sweetness to it and was very tender when I bit into it. So, yes. I recommend to try this dish. (And I know, it's a fish grill and I didn't order fish...but that means I have something to try next time!)

So. Why 3 stars? The price I felt didn't justify the means. I think they're going for a sort of high/medium class of food and service. But the location and menu just didnt seem like it. It's part of a department store, not an independent kind of store. The service wasn't bad and I thought if I give a 3, I have a chance to come back to it and give it another go at it.",2,3

The pizza was fine (just plain cheese, but lukewarm on delivery) and my husband likes their antipasto, but the order of fries we got was so overcooked they were almost inedible. Most of the fries were dried out and hard, like croutons more than fries. Worst of all: the chocolate cake we ordered was a joke. It was so stale it literally broke apart while I was filming a video to post on Yelp. Awful. It's got to be a week old at least.",2,0
2,"I never, in my life, expected the most authentic Mexican food I've had to come from a place in Wisconsin. I grew up in Texas, and you could find stellar Tex-Mex food on every corner, but authentic central Mexican dishes are had to find anywhere I've been. 

The moment I bit into my beef quesadillas, folded into that fluffy, crunchy, delicate corn masa shell, the food took me right back to my trip to Guanajuato. My only regret is that I only tried the one dish. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town.

I usually pick up togo from their Arcadia location and have never been let down, I have also had 1 good togo experience from this Norterra location.   Today, not so great.  I went to the bar to order and had to wait as the bartender was busy flirting with some gal at the bar.  I ordered my regular favorite item, Lentil Fatoush salad.   My food was brought out quickly and set in the bar area, the bartender watched him put the bag down but kept up with a conversation with a co-worker.  I finally got up went to get my food myself, so rudely interrupting their conversation, to make sure it was my order.  I guess I have that entitled attitude as a paying and tipping customer.  I was still excited about eating my favorite salad, only to get home and find out they made me a Rice Fatoush salad.  Usually it is mostly lentils with some rice, this time is was 90% rice with a few lentils mixed in with way more garlic than needed.  Sad face for me.",0,0
3,"Sorry Nine Fine, $7.50 for a Newcastle is a mugging and won't get you beyond two stars.

Nine Fine Irishmen is located inside the New York, New York casino.  It's more than just an Irish pub.  The ornate décor and split level venue make it seem a little more classy than a hole in the wall.  But I have serious gripes with this place.

The crowd: You are guaranteed to come across packs of oblivious tourists.  It starts as you wait to get in and only gets worse the deeper you get inside.  These are the folks who just stand in the middle of the room staring at the wall while you try to weave your way through.  They're inescapable.

The booze:  8 bucks for a Guinness and $7.50 for a Newcastle is about as expensive as it gets on the strip.  And when it's served in a clear college style plastic cup half the time, good luck expecting any kind of tip from me.

There are a few bright spots.  The venue itself seems very authentic.  And on many nights you'll have live Irish music which is certainly better than another dj playing Boom Boom Pow every 20 minutes.  But hey if that's your cup of the just go out to the patio seating and you'll hear the music bleeding over from Rok next door.  If you have money to burn I would go to Nine Fine during the day if you feel you must experience it, otherwise it's not worth it.",1,2

9,"I've been waiting a long time to try this restaurant. Just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on Yelp made it that much more exciting. It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. 

Okay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.

Next comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sautéed in butter and garlic. 

As for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner! I really enjoyed my dining experience here and what made it even better was the excellent service provided by the employees here. From the front reception area to the servers, valet, they are very friendly and cordial. Give them a try when you're in Vegas.",4,7

After doing my friend a favor, she and her husband take me and my husband to Thai Orchid Garden for dinner.  My friends are rather new to Thai food - my husband and I really enjoy it.

We have found a new Thai food place to habituate!  We loved the Thai toast with its wonderful sweet dipping sauce.  The pineapple fried rice was the best I've had in town, and close to the best ever.  My pad thai was delicious, moist, slightly sweet.  More cilantro and more meat  would have made it better, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My husband was less impressed by his pad see ew.  Friends' meat in garlic sauce and sweet and sour chicken were a hit.   We were quite full, but had a taste of the Thai custard and sweet rice - a perfect finish.

2,"I live in the building above this restaurant.  I've been there twice.  Both times, for the location.

The pasta here is so devastatingly mediocre, I almost cried.  The first time, I was just happy to have a restaurant in my neighbourhood.  I didn't even expect much, so when the food turned out so disappointing, I was crushed.  But location can't be beat, especially in the summer, when the area is bustling with activity and you can sit in the sun.

So, the food is bleh, whatever, it happens.
The reason I'm posting a review at all, is because I went into the *most charming* bakery that opened next door today and found that they are having to petition to keep their patio open because Eden put in a complaint to the condo board.  

Now, having lived in the area for 2 years, I've been waiting to see some shops flourish here-- pet stores and convenience stores have come and gone.  There is construction for 2 more condos and am sure there will be more in the future.  There will be more businesses - yes, restaurants too- that will come here, so they better get used to it.

I just don't get that kind of pettiness.  They could be supportive, after all Eden serves full meals and Cocoa is a bakery/cafe.  And the patios outside make for such good ambiance. 

Variety and competition never hurt businesses.  Maybe Eden will work a little harder to serve some decent food.

1 star for location.  1 star for patio.  Minus 3 stars for food that doesn't do the restaurant justice and poor sportsmanship.

4,"Shell, the founder and midwife here at Midwives Rising, was with me during my home birth as an emergency backup for my midwife.  She was wonderful...and her hands are small!  I say that because that's something you usually don't consider when choosing a midwife, but when you're at 7cm and they are checking your progress by sticking their hands in, it becomes something that you think about!!

Besides the small hands, Shell's a wonderful midwife for a about a billion other reasons.  1) She's an advocate for you.  She believes in you.  She believes in your power and your ability to birth that human being you've just grown inside you.  She believes in you knowing as much as possible about the process your going through and your body.  2)  She makes chocolate out of your placenta!!!  (if you want it of course.)  3) She supports the community through Midwives Rising and supports women's holistic health and empowerment in many ways.

If I really think about it, I should be disappointed. I get the feeling that once the show airs, my quaint little neighborhood diner is going to become a little harder to get in to.

Don't get me wrong, I am happy for Misty and the crew, and I hope the national spotlight proves to be a windfall for them all - but I will miss all the special attention they give this humble patron. I hope they remember this little guy when they hit it big. :)

By the way, for those of you who thought this place couldn't get much better, they just changed their awesome homemade potato chips and now they are 'even more awesome' - thinner and crispier than before, but still as delicious as ever.

And the chips aren't the only things getting better, time has certainly helped improve their skills in the kitchen, as just about everything is tasting better every time I order it.

For those East-Siders who don't get around to our side of town very often, this is one place I promise is worth the drive. Pretty soon, there will be all kinds of people driving a whole long way to dine at Rambo's Kitchen.

My suggestion, get here before the rush.",9,9

0,"Generally have a fun outing here at Rolling Hills.  Yesterday, that was spoiled by the gruff and rude Ranger Bob. He kept following us the whole back 9, when he was supposed to be a starter.  I was asked not to park inside the curb on 10 and obliged, but when my friend did it on 17, Bob lit into us, saying, ""I told you once and I'm not going to tell you again."" My friend wasn't aware I'd already been told about this. Sounded like a threat to me. Needless to say we did not appreciate his poor attitude at all. 
The curbs on each hole run back some distance from the approach to greens, so as to protect the grass on the other side.  On hole 17, which is a short par 3, there are signs sticking up out of the ground that read ""No Carts"" just in front of the green.  Generally you don't drive carts at all on par 3s.  So why have the signs there, signaling to people they can drive up to but not beyond the signs?  He accused us of doing so  anyway, which was a lie. Seems to me there should be a sign that reads ""Stay on Cart Path"" or the like.",0,0

8,"Wow!!! 

This is the best ice cream I have ever had - seriously, folks, this place shows Sweet Republic who's boss.  The ice cream is rich and creamy and full of flavor.  I tried the butter pecan, banana, peanut butter and chocolate.   The chocolate was unlike any chocolate ice cream I have had before - you could actually taste the coco flavor and it was more satisfying than a sugar loaded Hershey's concoction.  Bonus - they have pretzel cones!! This went especially well with scoops of chocolate and peanut butter! Yum!!

I hopped on the froyo train for awhile there, but this place is going to cause me to derail and get fat.  Oh well.  I'll be happy. 

The interior is a very cute, old-school ice cream parlor.  It reminded me of Smeeks.  There was not seating inside, but about 5 tables outside.  They also have lots of retro candies and freshly baked cookies and complimentary water in a jug (flavored with lavender and lemon).

Paid up for Octavius Tower (newest bldg), my room was next to the freeway with semi-trailer noise, the room wasn't very clean, there was noise coming through the vents (no joke), the pillow top beds are mediocre... Overall it was overpriced by 80% compared to other hotels.

- Traditional Serbian dishes

2,"Half-decent food. Absolutely abysmal customer service. 

I was working a show at the Benedum Center and placed a large order here ($150+) for the performers and crew to eat post-show. I ordered earlier in the afternoon and arranged a 9:45pm pickup (in other words, there was plenty of time to look at the order and get it right). I started to order online, but it was one of those websites that make you register, and I'm not local, so I didn't want to continue getting promo emails etc. for the rest of my life. Instead, I printed out the order directly from the order page and sent our venue runner with it to place the order (again, approximately 9 hours in advance).

Upon pick up, we discovered 2 of the sandwiches were wrong (like, not even close to what we ordered - called something completely different, and listed on an entirely separate area of the website). I called and politely asked if I could send our runner back so we could swap those out for what we ordered. The girl says she has to get a manager. The manager gets on and I explain and he says ""Well it says here in front of me that you ordered this"" I said ""No, and in fact I printed the full order directly from your website and I'm looking at it right now. That's not what was ordered."" (Mind you, this is about $12 worth of sandwiches out of a $150+ order for crew members that work really hard and deserve to eat what they want at the end of a long day). He says ""Well you're putting me in a really stick situation right now because what you're saying you ordered isn't what I have written down here."" Are you serious? How is it our problem that you wrote down the wrong thing when I literally gave you a printout of the order DIRECTLY from your own website? We weren't even asking for them to deliver it, and we offered to bring the wrong ones back, and I'm putting HIM in a sticky situation? GTFO. Literally the worst customer service. If your business can't afford to eat $12 on your own mistake, then maybe you should find another calling. 

I told him just forget it and hung up, and unfortunately our crew guys had to eat pizza because the sandwiches they received were disgusting. It's actually a shame because the pizzas were actually pretty good, but do yourself a favor and go somewhere that actually cares about their customers.",0,0

I got the sea salt caramel filled cupcake, and as a whole it was decent but nothing special. The cake itself was plain white/vanilla cake and was a little dry. It was filled with caramel, but the filling was only in the center and essentially just formed a block that didn't really add any flavor to the cupcake overall except by being overwhelming for 1-2 bites of the middle. The frosting was whipped, and it was way too light and fluffy for my girlfriend or I to enjoy. Normally I like whipped frosting, but this was so light that it was almost airy and more similar to a mousse and ultimately lacked sweetness or any flavor. There was a little caramel drizzle on top, but this caramel sea salt cupcake was more of a plain vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting and then small hints of caramel attempted to be added in.",0,0

Bread selection before dinner was unique with assorted bagel crisps and some strong anise (I think) flavored bread.  We ordered the chopped liver appetizer and it was decent given it was my first time trying it.  My parmesan crusted New York strip steak was medium rare as requested and tasted great.  The Parmesan crust was not very prominent and didn't add much so wasn't necessary in my opinion.  The sides (potatoes au gratin, onion rings, mushrooms) were okay but nothing special.

Dessert was my favorite course.  We shared their triple layer chocolate cake and chocolate sundae.  Cake was soft and chocolatey of course.  The sundae was very frozen vanilla ice cream in a chilled glass with dark fudge and fresh whipped cream on the side.  The sundae was delicious but could have used more toppings.

1,"This restaurant consists of a funky single room that is located in Shilla BBQ on Sahara next to the Palace Station, and is run full time by a sociable Hawaiian man named Wayne. I'm sure the place has a regular following, as it is impossible not to make friends with Wayne while you're there, as well as any other customers that come through the door. He is truly hospitable, and you can tell that he loves what he does. His website is worth going to for laughs (""the friends"" page is my favorite) and you'll learn there that the restaurant doubles as a karaoke bar, whenever a customer feels like singing. We were offered the option but respectfully refused, as we were not having sake at one in the afternoon. Wayne also takes requests, if you feel like watching a singing chef.

As soon as we sat down he brought us a little dish that had his own version of sunomono (pickled cucumber salad) as well as pickled bean sprouts. Both had great flavor and a touch of heat, but I just fell in love with the interesting sprouts. Though we were sitting at a table, we shouted our order to him over the bar, starting with the Cajun Ahi Salad (it's a one man show and the place is tiny). This addictive dish ($14) consists of Cajun rubbed ahi slices beneath a bed of mixed field greens and onion slices, and is dressed in Wayne's Ninth Island Asian Caucasian dressing. Though it was slightly overdressed and a bit pricey, the flavor was terrific and I loved the addition of crunchy cashews. We had a hard time choosing which rolls to get, but after much deliberation and instruction from Wayne (he told Audrey not to get the one she wanted - weird since they're all his creations) we settled on the Da Buggah Ono ($8, eel, jalapeno, crab, cream cheese and asparagus prepared tempura style with no rice) and the Mikey Mikey ($14, soft shell crab, shrimp tempura, and spicy tuna topped with spicy crab, avocado, and ahi). The former had great flavor but the tempura got too soggy from the muddy colored sauce and the latter was tasty, but very filling and similar to what you can get at other sushi places. Mikey, after whom the roll was named, was sitting at the sushi bar so I suppose we were sort of forced into getting that one. I have to say that I prefer the rolls at Sushi Fever, but I'd like to give some others on the menu here a shot.

We also had the black cod, or miso butter fish, appetizer ($8) and a side of chilled asparagus with Sum Young Gai sauce ($4). The fish was really flavorful (true to his slogan, ""it's all about the flavor"") but was previously frozen so the texture wasn't ideal (I much prefer the Black Cod Soy at Sen of Japan on Durango and Desert Inn). The asparagus was light, refreshing, and perfectly cooked, and went well with the creamy sauce. Then, as if we needed more food, he brought us complimentary baked oysters, which was generous (I should mention there were three of us so you don't think I'm a total pig). These were really unhealthy as they were baked with creamed spinach and topped with spicy mayo, but looked beautiful and were delicious.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any sashimi, which is the best indicator of quality at a sushi place.

I'm a college student and I constantly have mail coming and ever since I got a P.O. Box with this ups store all my mail suddenly started to disappear and arrive very late.

3,"Somewhat expensive, but I'm guessing it's part of their upscale-ish image. I only had the lox fried rice and some unnamed sushi samples. Naming it salmon fried rice would be less pretentious since it was pretty cooked. The sushi creations were pretty imaginative and unconventional, very fusion-like with the flavors. I think I tasted barbecue sauce on top? I'm not sure if I liked that. Plating is aesthetically pleasing.

The interior is pretty and modern. If you sit at the bar you can watch the chefs at work.

0,"Absoluely agree with Feisty from Chicago. We found the place mediocre at best. Service was pleasant, but slow. If you are happy payiing $64 for Veal Parmigianna -- which comes with absolutely NOTHING else -- then this may be your place. And the Veal arrived ""barely"" luke warm, with the cheese on top unmelted. Really? Is the kitchen serious with this presentation? Our group found the food lacklustre, compared to MANY other Itlaian Restaurants we have visited in both Las Vegas & other communities. $28 for an appetizer portion of Linguine Vongole, which had precisely 6 SMALL clams on top. $17 for a chopped salad that was ONLY lettuce, radicchio, endive etc. They do provide a VERY TINY piece of Parmigiana cheese at the start of your meal --- perhaps, literally, 1 inch square ---- along with some excellent bread. At the end of the meal each guest gets a single 1 inch square piece of Italian wedding cake, & a shot of Limoncella. Big deal.  You will also have to do a LONG search on the wine list to find bottles under $100 --- lots in the $200-$400 & $1,000+ range. So glad we did not waste money on a higher priced wine, on the food we received. Will keep it to drinks at the bar, & never eat there again. Especially since the speakers in the dining room were turned up sooooooooooooo LOUD that it made conversation unpleasant. If high prices, mediocre food, & a loud environment are not objectionable, then I hope you enjoy.",0,0

3,"I am usually partial to another tiki bar while in Vegas, but I decided to give Golden Tiki a try this time around.  We went on a Saturday night, and it was crazy busy!  But the bartenders were very attentive and quick despite the crowd.

I'd highly recommend the Mango Batida-creamy and fruity with just the right amount of alcohol.  My husband and I also had a Painkiller, a Blue Lagoon, and a Lime in the Coconut.  The Painkiller was fantastic, the Blue Lagoon was standard, and the Lime in the Coconut was cool looking but a little tart for me.  I think you probably can't go wrong with any of the drinks on the menu here.

Prices were great as far as tiki bars go, except the ridiculous minimum spend required for a table.  On the night we went, all of the tables were booked with reservations, and when one came available, the hostess told me there was a $90 minimum for 2 people.  This blew my mind!!  I'm not sure if this was standard practice or if she just didn't like the way I looked, because there was no sign saying anything like this.  And why on earth would a bar insist on customers having a minimum of 4-9 drinks before leaving/driving home?!  I'd love to know if anyone else has had this experience.  This ridiculousness is what knocked a full star off my rating.

If you're looking for a rowdy, interesting, but somewhat pretentious tiki bar experience, I'd recommend the Golden Tiki.  If a more casual, relaxed environment is for you, I'd recommend another tiki bar in town.  Either way, the drinks are great and you'll probably have a fun and memorable time.",0,1

3,"Um...there's food?

After a hellish taxi ride from Tempe to Phoenix (note: the atm across the street at desert schools spits out a FIFTY DOLLAR BILL if you ask for 50 bucks!), I couldn't believe how close this hotel/bar is to my usual CenPho hotspots! 3rd Ave and Clarendon? That is spittin distance from the Chez Nous! But I mean..who like goes down 3rd Ave, you know?

A beacon of prettiness in the desert, I was ushered into a lounge/bar that was actually pretty small. The low ceilings give a cosy but kind of clausterphobic feeling. I asked for a drink from the bartender, a kind of recommendation or specialty he had, and that I liked Gin. Um..he had like nothing really to offer? And I ALWAYS get G&T, but so many people raved about this place I was like, C'MON there has got to be some kind of hot drinks this ultra-chic lounge serves? I ended up with this kind of lime rickey martini that normally has vodka and he replaced with bombay that was pretty bomb-and the drink WAS HUGE. And not too expensive if I remember correctly (and I don't-b/c I bought two of those and a JD shot that he had overflowing- a shot? more like a full frontal machine gun assault?) .

The stools were high and the booths were pretty comfy-although I TOTALLy had SwampAss (or Swass) when I got up. This place was crammed wall to wall with hot gay guys. I think I saw a couple ladies but they were there for a hot gay guys birthday party that we all sang to-so there you are. I finally staggered around the space and discovered what I guess is the restaurant where people eat food at normal not too fancy two seaters. We went outside to a tiny lil seated patio to see a nice sky and balcony.

I wanted to see more of the hotel and ended up getting cited for having my libation near the pool (whoopsy!), but I was so psyched for the retro yellow loungers (ca-yute) and look inside the lil hotel rooms where the knobs (hehe) have the Clarendon Hotel symbol.

0,"Had a mini-staycation with the hubby and used my reward points to book a King suite.  Check-in was a breeze and the room was a decent size (along with a sofa, desk, sink, mini-fridge).  My two hangups were the AC unit and the wallpaper in the bathroom (I'm such a stickler for bathrooms).  The AC unit did not have a wall mounted control panel as it was located directly on the unit itself (which is not a problem per se).  After constantly lowering the temperature to cool off the room, my husband and I still had a difficult time cooling the room off.  It seemed as if the unit cooled for a brief time, no matter what temperature setting we attempted to set.  It may seem as if it is an operator error, but I travel frequently for work and had my share of setting temperatures for various units and this one was a little out of whack.

The bathroom was a decent size, but the wallpaper surrounding the bathtub/shower was peeling slightly and I could see what looked like mold/mildew from the moisture produced by the shower, which was a turn-off.  Otherwise, breakfast wasn't bad at all- the standard hotel breakfast with delicious cinnamon rolls.

Crooked Cue was other option my party has decided on. The atmosphere was average but for some reason all the house lights were turns way up, not common for a pub setting. Service was terrible. I know I was in for trouble when I asked the server for a 'Johnny Walker n Coke'  and she said ""Johnny Walker??' ... I looked at her and said ..'n Coke'... she replied ""in Coke?""... I said 'yes'... I looked at the rest of my part with a look of dread haha. Granted she may not be a drinker but as a server she must have heard of 'Rum n Coke' or 'Rye n Ginger'.. I realized I may be dealing with a novice server so it could be a challenge. Later my friend ask the server for what was on tap. She looked at him and simply pointed to the board across the room for the selection. I understand that a draught beer menu for some of the exotic beers change on a daily or weekly bases but she should already know the standard beer draughts that were available which I could clearly see from my table facing the bar. Basics such as Coors Light, Bud, Canadian, Rickards etc... so when I thought I was dealing with a novice server was incorrect... I was dealing with a LAZY server! I was a server for 4 years and it took time to learn the full list my restaurant has available but I at least made the attempt.. this girl didn't even try..In the end the food wasn't very good, charred burgers and frozen foods don't really make it worth the money you are paying.

I had never been inside of a Robeks before, nor any other 'healthy' drink type place so this was a 1st for me.  I found the offerings very healthy and the staff patient and helpful.  I finally settled on the Mahalo Mango with Soy protein.  It was very tasty as citrus beverages go, with a medium thickness, but had that powdery texture that comes with added extras.  It was OK.  I wasn't impressed and I won't make an effort to go back.  The only real downside for me is the prices.  I have 2 young children and we are a 1 income family.  Budgeting our money is priority and this place is just TOO EXPENSIVE for us.

Five stars for their food quality and overall flavor. This place is legit for the landlocked state of Nevada. Their seafood tastes super fresh and the oysters we had were plump and meaty.

The Pan Roast combo was packed with shrimp, lobster, and crab. It's a large serving but I managed to finish the whole bowl. It's served with white rice and comes with a sourdough roll. My roll was a bit chewy like it had been reheated one too many times in the microwave but it was sourdough so the flavor was A-OK. You could easily share the dish but be warned that they charge you a $5 sharing fee if you take up a seat but don't order your own entree. The seating is limited so I don't blame them!

There was not available space for my father and I to unload the couch, but no employees made space or gave us any direction. When I asked where we should put it they bumbled around but still did not make space for us to unload. Eventually we cleared space for ourselves by stacking their chairs on top of each other and stacked our couch next to them. I'm not sure if they were hoping we'd break their inventory so they'd have an easy sell or were simply too lazy and rude.

1,"We took my car to this Midas location because my fiance had taken his car there before and really liked the service and prices. My car was having issues with the heater, where it would blow on the cold side and hot on the passenger when the heat was on, and my windshield wipers were not moving up. 

We took the car there, and got charged $60 for running diagnostics on each thing, which I suppose is pretty normal. Through running the diagnostic they declared that the heater was fixed, and they let us know that the wipers needed a new motor. The new motor plus labour would cost us close to $500, not including the diagnostic fees. After initially decided that we would go for it, a closer look at our finances told us that we wouldn't be able to afford it, and my dad would try to fix it himself with a used motor. We let Midas know, they stopped working on it, and a few hours later my fiance paid the fees and picked up the car.

The heater worked for about half an hour, and then quit. As annoying as that was, I figured that its pretty normal with cars for that to happen, and we didn't really pay for them to fix it anyways, so I wasn't concerned. What was concerning was the wipers. We were told that they did not fix it, but upon testing them out, they worked! I was very excited. There was only one issue - the wipers alignment seemed off. The driver's wiper was going up all the way off the windshield. Upon closer inspection, I thought that the wiper arms were switched between the driver and passenger, but as I was a little confused about the whole thing I waited for my dad to come from out of town to check it out. 

Today, my dad was able to take a look. He switched the wipers back to their proper positions, and after he put them back on the wipers had the same issue they did before we took the car to Midas. My heart sank, but my dad told me it was an easy fix. He tightened the bolts on the pivot point for each wiper and, voila! It worked. 

So here my fiance and I were wondering - why didn't Midas just do that? And why were the arms flipped around? My fiance called Midas to complain - and here is where the worst part comes in - and the guy who had been dealing with him before simply denied everything. He denied that the technician would've flipped the wipers, and he denied that it was such an easy fix. He kept asking my fiance over and over ""well what did the guy do to fix it?"" and my fiance would tell him the same thing over and over. When my fiance explained about the heater, the guy told him that maybe he should get my dad to do it if he was so good. He did refund us, I'll give him that, but he essentially called us liars throughout the process.

Basically, $120 down, and there was no fix for the issues. The customer service was awful in dealing with an issue, and he basically told us not to come back. Well, his wish is granted.",0,0

2,"I am a Groupon customer and that is how I found out about this restaurant. While I didn't have any major concerns regarding the food, I did have an extremely poor customer service experience that goes along with previous reviewers in that the owner can not handle any sort of criticism.

On Groupon, I left a ""Tip for others"" that recommended the voucher due to fair value. I did point out that without the voucher, the prices were too high. The owner then messaged me through Groupon to send a condescending message accusing me of lying about their value.

I then left a review on their Facebook page, saying that it is unacceptable customer service to mock any sort of criticism toward the restaurant. There are also others, who have left glowing reviews of the restaurant but pointed out areas they could improve, and the owner ended up mocking them. This isn't a ""one-time"" mistake, this is an on-going issue in regards to feedback. To further prove this, the owner blocked me from their page and left a mocking ""sorry"" comment in response to my concerns on how they handle criticism.

Overall, I encourage people to avoid this restaurant based on how the owner disrespects its customers. There are many other restaurants with better value and better service so why waste your money here?

And to those wanting to try this restaurant using Groupon, don't. There are too many horror stories on how Groupon customers are mistreated with being forced to the back of the store, sat in a completely different section, told they can't use their Groupon on certain days with no warning, and slow/uncaring service.",0,0

2,"The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the food is very good...however the service is the worst I've ever seen... I ordered a mac and cheese for pick up, they said come in 20 mins.i was running late and got there in about 30 mins, and it wasn't even started yet...I had to wait for 45 more minutes to get my food.

I gave it a second chance and walked in and ordered a wrap and fries. Well this time it took 55 minutes, and it wasn't even busy, the owner was talking on the phone and having conversations with I guess friends who weren't even ordering food...

I'm done with this place and it's pretty sad because as I said the food is amazing...but their service ruined the whole experience for me..",1,1

0,"My husband and I consider Dinette one of our go-to places for dinner. Two appetizers and a pizza to share is perfect for our appetites. We have consistently enjoyed their creative salads and starters, and you really can't go wrong with any of the pizzas. The fact that they try to stay on top of what is in season is only another plus, in our book. The only downside, in terms of food, are their desserts. We haven't tried a single one that we've liked, and usually go across the street to Spoon if we are in dire need of some sugar.

It gets a bit loud, and it toes the line between being a nicer sit down place, and more casual eatery. Highly recommended. If you are familiar with Delfina Pizza in the Mission district of SF, this is pretty much a blow by blow copy? predecessor? to that. But with less hipsters.",0,0

The food however did not impress me at all.  Everything just tasted ""o.k."" and I found myself missing my cheap go to Chinese place back in my hometown.  When I eat Chinese food I expect the flavors to jump out at me and to entice me to eat more and more.  With this place I just felt like everything was unfortunately, bland.

The spicy salmon roll was solid, the saving grace of the meal.  The salmon itself was very fresh and flavorful and there was a delightful spicy, creamy sauce adorning each roll.  Should have just ordered two of these and left it at that.  But no, I had to spring for some of the Chinese as well.

The value was great for the portions of the Chinese dinner specials, but the actual Crispy Chicken entree left a lot to be desired.  First, the sauce was extremely sweet and there was about a quart of it in the dish.  The chicken was soggy, not crispy, and the veggies were julienned too thin for me to consider eating.

1,"This was truly a disappointment to pull up and discover this ""resort"" is located along the freeway with all its noise, and is nothing more than a parking lot. It's one step up from a rest stop along the highway in that there is laundry. Calling it a ""boutique resort"" is absolutely false advertising. There isn't even an office here, or anyone to greet you. There are absolutely no amenities that fall under a ""resort"" designation. The amount they charge to sleep in a parking lot they call ""secure"" (how is it secure with no gate? Where someone along the highway can just step onto the property?) is also ridiculous. I would never stay here again.

EDITED TO RESPOND TO THE OWNER RESPONSE: 

The ""amentities"" you list are what any ordinary RV park offers. Instead of defending your common amentities why don't you remove the word ""resort"" in your title as that is what every negative review you have received takes issue with. 

Your ""spacious"" rv park still lacks individual tables for each space, grass or shade, something for families to do here like swim in a POOL. There is no community room either, like the majority of places we have visited. I don't know what kids would even do here other than run around your giant sandbox of a park. 

You can defend and defend but after staying in dozens of RV parks I have never seen one so dismal and empty of promises. There is no office here with a presence of management. I have seen one golf cart with an employee zip through a couple times but other than that, nope. Your dog park is a dirt patch surrounded by fencing. There is no quarter machine available in the laundry room that you constantly defend as an amenity and when we crossed the street (which is actually further away than you let on) to ask the office for change, they only had a single roll of quarters on hand. 

Instead of defending yourself why don't you spend more time trying to set better expectations for people and not try to sell them on the ""resort"" aspect that DOES NOT EXIST HERE. We are not blind and we are not fools. Most of us spend time at many, many, many other parks and know you are selling snake oil here with your ""resort"" status that is simply not true. It is a basic park that lacks even tables at each space. Tables. Surely that is something you could provide for each resident at your ""resort"". 

This is the most expensive park we have ever stayed at, with the least amount to offer. It is deceitful the way you promote this place, and that is my main issue. And appears to be the main issue of every complaint on Yelp. 

Your snarky approach to our legitimate complaints further shows what customer experience and satisfaction means to you.",0,0

The restaurant wasn't too busy when we got there (a Sunday evening). We've notice a patio outside which will be great on warmer days. We shared a beef carpaccio as an appetizer which was just ok. They served it with spinach instead of arugula on top, which was not as good. My husband had the seafood linguine, which was delicious. I had the simple spaghetti with basil tomato sauce and it was quite good as well. After we finish our meal, the server offered us some dessert and told us that the Tiramisu was on him. So we ordered one, but they somehow still charged us for it. It was too awkward to ask about it so we paid for it anyway, since we initially wanted to order one regardless.

FYI, the continental breakfast doesn't include eggs - I saw plenty of people looking in a heating tray thinking there were eggs, only to look disappointed when they saw croissants and pastries. But that's no reason to skip the breakfast, which includes Cheerios and corn flakes, bagels, croissants, fruit and pastries, along with juices and coffee (it's not gourmet, but it's caffeine).

We go back in today and we are told the downpayment is now 565.00 plus a 25.00 fee we were never told of by Josh and with taxes we are looking at 661.00 down so basically 90 percent of the phone . 
They have the iPhone trade in special and we asked Josh about that and he said that we would get 300.00 for our phone and part of the would be take off the down payment and the rest would be mailed by a gift card .
Today I am told my phone is only worth 120.00 and that we have to send the phone in where Josh told us they don't even take the phone.

1,"This review is for the club.

We were a group of six guys who came here on Friday night. We had arranged bottle service with a host called Roman and there was only a one bottle minimum which was nice (some of the bigger clubs would make you buy two or more bottles for a group of 6 guys). We ended up getting two anway but it was nice that it wasn't required to get a table.

I have been to the club at Lavo a few times and have always had a good time. Its a bit small and doesnt have the visual wow factor of a place like XS but the music is always good and I have always found the guys at the door to be way more courteous than at other clubs. 

This time we got bottle service and our contact at the club, Roman, was really a class act. He got us in promptly, and checked in on us to make sure we were happy. He even texted a couple times (including the next day, yes for real, he texted the next day to say he hoped we had a good time.. easy to do but i've never had a host do that before). When I texted him later that night to ask if he could get a friend in who was late he replied in moments saying it was no problem. My friend took a long time showing up and Roman took the initiative to check with me if he had showed up or not. All pretty basic stuff, but again I've rarely seen the host so on top of things.

The service here was so much better than how we got treated the next night at Marquee. I think in the future when I come to vegas I will avoid the newest club and go with a classic. I think of places like Tryst that way and I'm adding Lavo to the list. Seems like a sure thing.",0,0

They don't accept credit cards though, thank goodness I had cash otherwise I would have been a super unhappy camper. It's 2010, come on! Credit cards should be widely accepted, especially in Vegas! But other than that, tasty food.",0,0
3,"Asiana sushi is located across the street from the US Bank Building and is located right next to a New York Sandwich shop. I was on business travel and I saw this place and thought 'how good is Arizona sushi?'. This place isn't meant for fine dining by any means. However, it is meant for a quick lunch at a decent price. The quality of sushi is pretty good. I got the sushi & sashimi bento($11) and I also tried the red snapper katsu(new item on the menu).  The sashimi bento consists of 5 pieces of sashimi and 5 pieces of sushi. One tuna, one shrimp, one tuna, one red snapper, one imitation crab, and 2 pieces of tuna sashimi , 3 pieces of red snapper. All the bentos come with 2 pot stickers, rice, salad, 4 pieces of california rolls and your main course. The red snapper katsu was pretty good and it was the first time I've tried it. They have affordable bentos ranging from $7 to $10. The place has a bit of a cafeteria feel because they have an open kitchen, meaning, you can see the people preparing the food rather than a closed kitchen. I don't recall seeing a sushi bar, either. They have a cute snack section right when you walk in to the left serving various asian snacks. As the restaurant owner, I'd close up the kitchen and also include sushi bar seating. It looks like they're pretty new because I see a grand opening sign. I think they may be Filipino owned. Great lunch spot for those that are looking for japanese food on the cheap. 

They accept visa, mastercard and american express.",1,1
2,"You walk in and immediately get greeted by the fog/smoke from the grills. Could use more ventilation.

AYCE that includes not only meat and seafood, but also some items cooked in the kitchen. Take note, you can only order 4 items at a time. 

We ordered japchae, gyoza, and KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) from the kitchen, there were 6 of us, servings were small, each of us just had a bite of each item, the serving seemed to me, good for one person. So make sure to maybe triple up these items. We ordered their KFC a few times while we were there. 

There was only a few banchan items - kimchi, pickled cucumber, pickled onions, edamame and mashed potato. I haven't seen mashed potato before as part of banchan. I've been to other KBBQ places that came with more banchan. No plain lettuce leaf, just lettuce salad. 

We ordered a variety of meats including chicken and steak. Chicken and their steak are thicker cuts that will require longer cooking time. The rest are you typical thin sliced fast cooking meats. Personally the food was ok, even their Chadol (shaved beef brisket) was just ok. Chadol is one of my favorite meats for KBBQ, I wasn't feeling it that time. 

In summary: good food, fun for groups, my favorite that night was their KFC. They do not take reservations. Service was great!",0,0

I had one half just cheese and the other half kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes and fresh basil. It was a great pizza. However, the service and delivery were terrible. It took over an hour for the delivery and I even called the place to make sure everything was good to go since I ordered online. The woman on the phone was very nice and assured me the driver left. Shortly after, the delivery man came storming to the apartment saying he couldn't find it and that next time I should tell them a building number...there are no building numbers and I gave him the apartment number so I didn't feel he needed to say that. Also, I ordered online which was extremely convenient and easy but maybe next time I will give step by step directions on how to read numbers on an apartment door...",0,0
1,"arrive on time and are told there will be a wait (as always at cleaver - whatever). They were self-assuredly kind enough to offer a round of prosecco on the house -- nice, differentiating touch. Then we get to the 30-minute mark of waiting outside in the cold for our table and I request another round on the house. Waiter obliges and brings it over making it clear that it's also on the house. We finally get seated about 55 minutes after initial reservation. As we are being walked to table ""manager"" apologizes profusely for delay and says first round is on the house. So we decide to order great cocktails to start even though plan was to just drink wine. fast forward through a good meal with great food and company; we even made friends with the girl at the next table. Service returns to gruesomeness when the check comes. Collectively we were under the United understanding that we were getting a total of three drinks comped. Waitress thinks it's just one.  Politely set her straight and get the earlier waiter involved, remind him that we requested the second prosecco be comped and he explicitly stated it was comped when we delivered it to our table. He relented. Then it comes to our attention that the first round was also on the bill, and both the waitress and the waiter want to fight us. I request manager. This is when things get theatrical. We engage in respectful but forceful pushback on the bill and he responds with vitriol colored by years of disillusionment. He says we should be grateful that the first two drinks were comped and forget comping the third. We remind him that we were outside for an HOUR in windy 8C weather with improper heatlamps (they're there but do positively nothing) and that's when he flashes into a memory of himself as an angry father beating his children (meanwhile were being far humbler than necessary by ""apologizing for miscommunication""). He yells at us for changing the reservation from 8 to 6 to 4 and says we should count our blessings because no one yelled at us before. (For the record, we diligently called to shrink the reservation, giving ample notice, and when we were finally escorted from the freezing patio over an hour after our reservation the waiter appeared relieved that we were 4, not 6, because otherwise he wouldn't have had another table and there would've been no hope for us). Then the manager absolutely loses his calm and bellows that we should never come back to the restaurant. EVER. IN OUR LIVES. So let's be real and recapitulate this dysfunction. We are left to freeze for an hour to have to demand second prosecco, everything is made okay by the promise that first round of cocktails is on the house. Then he kicks us out in a fit of anger, even though he and his team entirely screwed us over, and we were obviously more than convinced to never go back anyway. The waitress was as incredulous as we were at his actions but couldn't do much. I asked her if he has anger issues and she said she couldn't answer...that's a yes.",2,0
0,"A great place to chill and wait for your seat at Holsteins.  

Cosmopolitan is always one of my favorite places to shuffle friends through when I am playing Tour Guide. I love showing off how Frou-Frou this place is to my gal pals in town because there is no girl that doesn't appreciate all the crystal, marble floors and shiny-objects that make girls swoon. 

We came to Cosmopolitan to eat at Holsteins and the Chandelier lounge is directly across from the enterance so we say here to wait for our seats to be ready. 

Most of the choices on the drink menu were above average in price. I ordered the Fire-breathing dragon martini everyone's talking about on yelp-it was good and definitely worth trying and I had a few bucks to spare ($15 I think) . My home girl ordered the Rose Champagne ($18) for a glass. Must be good stuff. Lol 

It's a cute lounge to sit and chill in, but I wouldn't spend all my time there, too much to spend on drinks and there's way better deals on the strip. But a fun place to stop. 

Cheers!

I have made the mistake multiple times of going into Bartrams during busy times and placing an food order.    Today I had a meeting to go to and wasn't thinking.   I went into Bartrams and they were relatively busy.   I forgot and placed an order for one of their salads.   After waiting a over 25 minutes for the meal to come I had to go up and tell them to stick it in the fridge I would be back for it after my meeting.   I show up to pick up the order after my meeting and they've missed part of my order.   I'm still dealing with work since it's now long after lunch so I don't realize it until I'm away from the place so I lose.    I won't say I won't ever go back to this place as their food and pastries are really good but they stink when it comes to really taking care of their customer so they will not have my business again for three to four months to make up for this.",0,0
8,Very cold atmosphere and not too pleasant front desk clerks. Waited 2 hrs for the Dr to show up for a few minutes with at least 3 interns. Seems you have to pay for everything before they will help you relieve your pain. Said they called me to tell me the procedure was approved but never did. Sent me away after being late 4 minutes but yet came back to see a PA and she was late 15 minutes. The office in dysfunctional to say the least.

1,"Ive been to Wimpys many times. I usually order the original hamburger meal. It was excellent until recently they changed their burger. Why change a good thing?? Now the burger is nothing special. Not enough to come back craving it. One thing I like is you get a good bang for your buck. Dinner for two is like less than $25 if you play your cards right. However I dont think the cooks are that friendly to their employees. One time I had to ask a waitress if she was okay she seemed upset and crying after she was yelled at by one of the cooks. That was unprofessional. I felt really bad for her. Not sure when I return now, switch back the burger!",0,0

0,"Had some friends in town this weekend , which resulted in us all being hungover on Sunday needing something greasy that we could pickup. Pinkys happens to be right down the street from my new house so we decided to give it a shot. Like how bad can something be if Guy Fieri's into it , right? 

I pulled up to pinkys which is actually decorated pretty cool both inside and out. Was kinda bummed we got it to go as it seemed like a cool spot to grab a burger and a beer. Decor , fun environment , and seemed to be pretty good happy hour options is where a lot of my allocated stars are going. 

The food however left something to be desired. I ordered the garlic lime chicken tacos , and upon taking my first bite noticed I had in fact received buffalo shrimp tacos. Being the lazy host who picked the closest place to my house for pickup , I decided not to say anything. Im just going to eat these shrimp tacos , but I couldn't t. There was entirely too much buffalo sauce , the shrimp were undercooked very chewy , and cold inside. I thought it was in my best interest to throw them out. I  wasn't furious because I also ordered the crab hushpuppies , which were actually pretty solid , and I would recommend. One of my guest got the mammoth burger , which didn't have any of the condiments or  toppings he requested but he did say it was a pretty good burger.  He ordered a side onion rings to share , which were kind of like shoe string onion rings. I feel like they would have been pretty good if they weren't so cold and soggy. One guest ordered the fish tacos , which he said tasted like captain ds. I have never been to Captain Ds so I'm still uncertain if this was a good or bad thing , I didn't ask him to elaborate because I didn't wanna look like a nerd for never getting captain ds. We also got the corn dog shrimp to share , which were by far the best corn dog shrimp I've ever had but also the only. 

I apologize for the monster previous paragraph , if anybody's still here I would recommend If you're getting it to go , I would at least checking your food before you leave. Lets face it , to go food is never as good as dine in food (excludes Chinese). I will probably give Pinkys another shot because its a mile from my house and some of the stuff was good , but I will be dining in.",0,1

3,"First Impression: the employees were very welcoming and helpful. They walked me through the menu and after some thinking I decided to try their Big Wolf's Reuben. 

The Experience: they make the Rueben with Corned Beef, Sauerkraut, Swiss cheese topped on Marble Bread (which has butter on one side and Big Wolf's secret sauce on the inside). They grab a brisket of corned beef from their meat steamer (piping hot) and they place it on an automatic slicer. 
They usually cut the meat nice and thin (better taste) or you can request to have it cut thicker. After weighing out the meat (it's a lot I only got a 1/4 lb) they put it on the sandwich and add all the ingredients. Then they take it to the panini press so it can toast the bread and melt the Swiss cheese (which is real genuine cheese so that's a plus). It's then served with a side of coleslaw or potato salad (I couldn't choose so I took a bit of both) with a pickle on the side. 

The Taste: my first bite into the Reuben and I seriously couldn't believe how good it was. All the ingredients melted into the sandwich perfectly to create a mixture that was absolutely delicious. I have never had a Reuben this good. The potato salad and coleslaw were also very appetizing (I wasn't expecting much because I'm not a fan of both, but this recipe is definitely worth it). I also purchased a bottled coke and I must say it just tastes better bottled than it would in a can. 

The employees took the time to ask me how my meal was and make sure I had everything I needed. For a quick dining restaurant, the customer service was far better than expected. I would definitely come back here and try their Pulled pork (I had a small sample and it was incredible). 

Would recommend to others looking for a filling hearty meal that's affordable in a clean environment.",1,2

I've always made an appointment by phone or online with no problem, and know that I will have to wait if I don't.  I was super bummed to find out yesterday that Laz is moving on to open his own franchise very far away.  I wish him well, but I won't come to V's Arcadia if he's not there.

My 3 star rating is for the company and experience as a whole.  If I wasn't loyal to Laz, I would never come here.  The haircuts are $21 + tip which is a lot for a 5 minute haircut in my opinion, and the prices are going up again in a couple weeks.... and the parking is a complete joke with Arcadia Tavern and the valet situation.  There are not enough parking spots to accommodate that business, and they should have done something about it when they moved in.  I'm not getting my car valet'd for my 5 minute haircut to tip some kid to park my car.  Biggest silly scam business ever.  I've had to park my car up on the sidewalk at the west exit of the complex on multiple occasions, hoping I wouldn't get towed or hit by another car as they leave.  The parking situation hurts business for everyone in that complex, as you can imagine how many people just go elsewhere since there is never anywhere to park...  And you can't help but notice the barbers constantly cracking jokes with each other and clowning on people in multiple foreign tongues all the time.  It is off-putting and unprofessional, esp. if you're a new customer. Yesterday the barber in chair 2 was talking to his client, and cussing very loudly with a child sitting in a waiting chair right behind him.   It's just what they do there, and it is unprofessional.

I wish Laz all the best and will miss him for sure, but will be looking for a new place to go that is more wallet friendly and convenient.",0,0

Service was average. Don't expect similar atmosphere as Guu Izakaya - the restaurant was pretty quiet which I enjoyed. The menu doesn't offer many choices but they're at affordable price.

This was my go to Place for Turkish Pizza (Pide) then Alara opened and the Chef Mustafa moved there and I thought this would suffer but surprisingly this place was still better than Alara.

First for the Lahmachun the dough was great as always but now for the meat topping it was bland and no flavor. Its like they only seasoned it with S&P and red pepper flake here and their thats it. Seemed like a poorly made at home attempt IMO of this addictive stuff. 
Sujuck Pide was even a bigger disappointment. The Sujuck (Turkish Pepperoni I guess) was devoid of taste and fell flat. I don't know whether they have changed sources for it or maybe have westernized it for mass market this one was poor reflection of glory days of this place.

2,"WORST BIKE SHOP EVER!!!!!

I had taken my daughters bike in for a tune up mainly for the front and rear duerailers.  The employee obviously didn't want to be there on a Sunday morning, Im grateful if the job I have so I have no sympathy. He said it would be ready monday or Tuesday, I said ok I can take it somewhere else. He said ""that's what we've been instructed to tell everyone so they don't have high expectations, it should be ready this afternoon"". I was like, ""ok cool"".  

I got the call several hours later saying it's done.  So we went there and now there is another employee present with same Attitude.  I said I was picking up my daughters bike, told them my name, and they went to look for the bike. The back isn't very big so I was wondering why it almost took 10 mins to retrieve the bike. He finally came up and said he mistaken it with another bike...hmm. Ok, no biggie. He said $59.00 is due. I said let me take it for a spin before I pay, he was taken aback and said confusingly, ""ok"". So I took her bike out for a spin ran theu the gears, I was like,""ok sweet nice and smooth"". Turn around and got to stop at the front door and squeezed the brakes, front stopped as usual but the rear lever went all the way to the handlebar and nothing. I went inside and told them gears are great but the rear brake didn't even engage the caliper. He was like ok, 59 dollars how do you want to pay. I then said again the brakes aren't working. He said ok well that's because when we racked it air bubbles got in the line. I told him I rack the bike at home and it never does this. He said that means u need to bleed and adjust the brakes. I said again it was working when I brought the bike in.  

Now the other lazy guy with dark brown hair who was eating and on the computer chimes in, you can pay for a brake bleed and mineral oil.  Then they told me ""You're just looking to get something for free"" . I asked ""don't you guys go thru the bikes or test ride them when they're done?"" They never mentioned the brakes needed adjusting or bleeding until I brought it up. The both were full of excuses and were insulting, basically telling me to leave. So I left, I was putting the bike away and didn't like how it all went down, so I went back in and said, "" I didn't like how you two accused me of wanting something for free"", and the worker said sorry u feel that way.   I then offered to pay for half because I need my daughters brakes working. One employee with blonde hair said, ""you know what your right, we should of told you about the brakes not working and should of caught it in the tune up, we'll bleed the brakes for free.""  I again offered to pay for half and he declined. So I left the bike to be finished. 

If I would of left and not went back to stand up for myself, Bike Masters would of let me leave with an unsafe bike for my child. 

I'll never return to that bike shop again, I'll tell everyone I know to stay far away from that dishonest shop. I feel bad for the owner, good help is hard to find.",0,0
0,"After doing a lot of online research we were ready to start our small synthetic grass project next to our pool. I priced out the grass online and at a few local stores before visiting the SGS. I'm actually glad I saw the others before visiting. I honestly thought this place would be over priced and try to upsell you on top dollar everything. I was pleasantly surprised when Tosha greeted us and immediately gave us a price sheet. Our project was small and she suggested an end piece of a roll for an even greater discount. So we spent about half on materials than we had anticipated! My biggest concern about synthetic grass was that it would look fake or like Astro turf. We were able to get a heavier weight and more realistic grass here. I also loved that they have their samples on the outside and inside of their building. So you can see it in the natural sunlight outside. Tosha really listened to what our goals were on our small do it yourself project. With quality project materials and a lot of videos, internet searches and manual labor we saved probably about $500-$800 dollars doing this project ourselves and with the help of the SGS. I would highly recommend this store.",0,0

3,"I feel so horrible writing a bad review especially seeing how so many people love this place -- maybe we just went on a off day. Based on reading other reviews, it seems Montesano's does pizza and desserts well -- so maybe I'll give it another shot one day. Not anytime soon though, we need some time to recover and forget the bad tasting pasta. 

The boyfriend and I had carbonara and spaghetti bolognese. We were absolutely underwhelmed. My pasta carbonara was overcooked and was just so dry with very few pieces of meat that wove through the linguine. Bf's spaghetti... ugh. We make better at home. 

Staff is very friendly! Bf did mention how he asked our waiter what their favorite item was -- and waiter didn't seem to have a favorite and prefers their pasta simple with garlic and EVOO. That worried us a bit. How can you not have favorites??

People seem to like their garlic knots but I've had much better at places like C&O in Venice, CA. Theirs was hard and dry. 

Maybe we'll give it another shot one day... hopefully it'll be better.",3,2
0,"Have had several bad experiences here. Last time was a carryout order they couldnt seem to get right. On the 4th try a manager came out and said it was a new menu item they didnt have all the ingredients for and gave me a 10 dollar coupon. Against my better judgement i decided to go back tonight to use it since i had to stop at a store nearby.  Ordered waters, kids lemonade and spinach dip soon as we sat down. Received the waters and ordered a bar drink, and he said hed be right back with the lemonade. Finally got our drinks from the bar but still no lemonade. Reminded him about it and ordered. Got the lemonade and then the food very fast. Still no spinach dip. Think he said they dropped it? Even still, it takes 5 minutes if even to microwave and now it had been a half hour. Food came out fast, but was cold. French onion soup was cold and caeser salad had a hair in it. Asked for a new one. THE SECOND ONE ALSO HAD A HAIR (which positively was not mine or anyones at the table).  Alfredo had very little sauce and i had to ask for the breadstick it was suppossed to come with. Spinach dip finally came. Chips were stale. Asked for the check. Salad was taken off but was charged way more for adding shrimp to the alfredo than the menu stated. I paid for it anyway and as we were walking out the manager finally came over to offer another 10 dollar coupon. I said no thanks i will not be returning.",0,0

I usually order rolls at these restaurants as you can't go wrong with a red dragon roll (8.95$) - dynamite roll topped with salmon . I also ordered a golden dragon roll (8.95$) which is a dynamite roll topped with unagi and salmon. 

I'd recommend the golden one as it is the same price and you get both salmon and unagi! The restaurant is snug so it'll likely only fit a group of 6 max. Great for lunch too.",0,0

They hand you a receipt instead of telling you your total, without saying a word...same thing when they give you your order. The only one of them even said to me was that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH. As if that's not bizarre enough. Yet, as I stood there, I noticed how talkative and nice they were to each other, so it's not like they're having a bad day. Service is terrible there.

That said the deliciosity of such local favorites as the commuter sandwich, gladiator pizza or red velvet cupcakes mean nothing if this local business does not care about it's local environment.  

It has recently come to my attention via social media that LGO DOES NOT RECYCLE. 

I repeat LGO Does not recycle. 

It's difficult to give such a great business with great service a bad review.  Then again it was also difficult to learn that Michael Vick ran a dog fighting ring, Joe Paterno turned a blind eye to a pederast or that Lance Armstrong did more cheating than a desperate housewife.  

That said, the truth is the truth and this place won't get another dime from myself (nor hopefully my 300plus yelpers friends in Phoenix) until they come clean.

They shaved him down to the skin but did not touch the hair around his head, nor the tail.  Whoever cuts his hair definitely has no idea how to do it.  They should have told me if they don't know how to cut a Pomeranian. When I saw my dog, I was speechless and I will never recommend anyone to bring their dogs for this torture!!",6,1

The only sale they had were the clearance purses that nobody wanted & trying to get rid of.  If you want a cute purse you are paying full price.  The people working there are a little pushy and will only offer you a 20% discount if you buy an accessory.  I was not at all impressed with this outlet mall.

1,"Purchased the food here twice. First time chicken curry it was okay at best and the portion was tiny! The second time was mikes special chicken and rice and peas. The rice and peas were above most restaurants and the chicken was also very tasty. The problem was the portion was so small. Not a fan of restaurants that add pops in on a forced combo. It seems like what they did in the '80s and 90's. I prefer to buy my meal at fare price and drink my pop at home which I purchase by the case at 6-7 dollars and or  .24cents a can. 

Bottom line is this place has to upsize their portions on the Jamaican style food and lower the prices on the American style. I also have seen their salads, They look like beds of lettuce with a couple small pieces of peppers.

For every customer that feels like they did not get the deal they would appreciate, you lose the customer. Lots of locals eat out in Brampton, this will lead to retention loss. If I was owner I would want less profit on single purchase but a larger amount of steady sales. Lets see how this one plays out. Going to be interesting to see how this story ends.",0,0

It's got the basic menu and they're more than willing to augment a dish to suit your preferences.

They have family specials, but on those, they are not too keen on changing the choices.

I would recommend ordering from the regular menu, and stay away from the family specials.

0,We had an experience with the EMU which was stellar but the scheduling department for imaging and nuke tests is inept and inconsiderate. There are two people who answer the phone there. Both are rude and inconsiderate. One counted from ten to one out loud then hung up on me. Called back and the other did not count. She just hung up. I was told they are trained to do that. What's that all about? But given the way this place runs I am not surprised. These are the scheduling people and they act that way. Despicable. My wife is deaf and there is a HEPA on file to call me. They have the number but called my wife's phone instead and left messages. These people have canceled three appointments my wife had been waiting for leading up to brain surgery and rescheduled them without telling or asking us. One was this coming Friday the second at 6am that is no longer. So as it stands three appointments scheduled are now cancelled. Calls to the management met with the same talk over and rudeness. Guess it trickles down from the top. The important one is my wife who is now out in the cold. She had mentally prepared herself for these tests leading up to brain surgery but without a care this place's staff chose to mess with her and treat me really bad when I demanded accountability and a simple explanation. I called the one lady a Dink. She did not like it leading up to her famous 10 to one count down then hang up. We are supposed to put our trust in this place to give her a better way of life. It literally terrifies me that the likes of these people I have been dealing with today are involved in my wife's brain surgery. When will someone care about my wife the subject of all this mess. No one but me has said anything about her. I have spend the last 3 and a half hours trying to work things out but have failed. No one at this hospital cares about my wife. It's all about them and how they feel. It's bad enough they mess up but argue with me when I ask for an explanation. And have the nerve to hang up and their boss has the nerve to condone their bad behavior and take their side. So here we are in Limbo. It is not due to insurance issues. We have great insurance through Blue cross. The employees at this hospital have lost something. That is caring and compassion. Very very sad. But we will be fine though. We are moving all of her medical care to another facility with less ineptness.,0,0

0,"I didn't really get to experience the real atmosphere of this place, so this is more of a drive thru review. I love to support and going to local business and I like the originality. The reason for the 3 stars is mainly the price point and bakery/snacks in drive tru. So the menu online is not what I encountered there. I ordered a small mocha and it said to pull to the window for food items. My small mocha came to $5, so I was hoping it was going to be worth it. The bakery items sounded interesting like an oreo or nutella  handmade scone. However I wasn't going to spend another $5 to try it. Most other items were $4.50 or more. So I just got the drink. It was filled to the very brim. Yes I want every sweet drop I can get, I did pay $5, but I'm driving so spillage was gonna happen. I was hoping the flavor would be above average, but it really wasn't. I thought the cream or milk ratio was a little high and over took the coffee taste. I will give it another try cause it is my closest local coffee joint. Next time I will just go for a coffee. I would also love to chill inside and order a good meal off the menu it all sounds pretty good and the prices don't seem too expensive, unlike my mocha. I do expect to maybe pay more from a local place, but I just can't see paying $5 for a small too often. Call me cheap, but if it was more delicious I wouldn't have as big an issue.",0,0

Orders did not arrive at the same time, but we did not have that expectation and were not bothered by it, perhaps because we were chatting and/or our tea and water was refilled while we were waiting.

The pool area is great, but being in Summerlin, if you don't have a car, you're pretty much relegated to the complex (which there's shopping across the street with standard retail fare like a Best Buy) which does have a movie theater (but who goes to Vegas to watch a movie?), so I think it's time for another facelift or reinvention to give people a unique reason to go off-strip and party like rock stars at the Red Rock day and night.",0,0

A couple months ago, my wife and I decided to build a custom closet. I came across Custom Closet Systems on Yelp and decided to give them a call. I spoke to Alfredo and we made an appointment to take measurements. 

From the moment Alfredo arrived at my home, I knew I called the right company. Alfredo was on time, courteous and friendly. He answered all my questions and gave me some great recommendations, all while taking measurements. Once he was done, he stated he would call me to setup a time to come to his showroom to show us his design. 

We ended up meeting a few days later at his showroom to discuss his thoughtfully planned design. Alfredo was extremely patient, again answering all of our questions. We made a few minor changes then put a deposit down for the install.

About a month later, Alfredo's brother, Alessandro came by (on time) with a few installers to install our closet (the brothers own the company). Alessandro and his crew kept the job very clean, they were extremely courteous and did a meticulous and outstanding job on the install! When they were done, I was literally in awe. I felt as if I was starring in my own episode of MTV Cribs! We have received so many compliments on the design and build. We cannot be happier with the results. I honestly feel bad giving only 5 stars.

Alfredo and Alessandro built a great company that delivers both on quality and customer service - a true rarity in today's age. I would not hesitate to refer Custom Closet Systems to my friends and family! THANK YOU GUYS!",0,1

No information and no one had knocked or rang attempting to delivery.  Tried again for an apparent third time, at same time as first delivery attempt and again no one was home. Left information how to call and have package held for pick up. Called and its already been sent back to the original sender...

The person with customer service I spoke too could barely contain their lack of care and did next to nothing to help me aside from telling me to call the original sender. So GSO immediately passed the buck after bungled attempts to deliver.

Not too much to say other than if you have a family and you want a better alternative to fast food, this is the way to go. Not too expensive, fairly priced, and depending on what you get, especially from a kid's perspective, you'll certainly have leftovers (if you get the rotisserie chicken basically) for someone young or with a small appetite.

Another friend ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with fried onions and a side of their fresh cut fries. She enjoyed her sandwich and we both enjoyed her fries (she let me taste one :-).

1,"Drinks were great, staff was incredibly friendly, and if you're an adult, this is a fine place before around 10 pm, at which point it turns incredibly...we'll call it bro-y. Kinda like Hooters with really loud music. The female bartenders went from wearing pants to...not pants, basically underpants with chaps that had more or less all of the denim material cut out. Kinda weird, but if that's your thing, have at it. There's a mechanical bull, the music gets earsplittingly loud, and the crowd gets rowdy, which is great if you're looking to get rowdy as well, but notsomuch if you're looking to have a conversation. If you're not super duper hammered, this is a terrific place for a drink or two before 10. If you're not part of a bachelor/bachelorette party or looking to get super hammered, I'd recommend finding another bar in the area after 10.",0,0

This would get 4 stars but the service was really slow and not that friendly. I had to ask three times for hoi sin and the tea came out warm instead of hot they need to tweet some dishes to get a 4 and I hope they do!!",0,0
4,"This was removed originally from the Pearson Eyegroup. the doctors were excellent. the used car salesman tactics at Lenscrafters should be illegal! My original post follows.

Total ripoff! The eye doctor was excellent, efficient and Knowledgeable. The glasses selection process is a scam. I picked out some frames and was quoted a price of $550! After insurance it was $510! Really? Frames were $210 retail minus $60 and 20% off the balance with Eyemed plan. That right there is a $90 discount. I won't even go into the rest. The glasses should have been around $300 tops.

17,"After reading the reviews for The Dump we were a bit worried at the outcome of our purchase.

Denis was extremely professional, funny and helpful.  No pushy sales at all!  

We were able to find a great outdoor fire pit set, sectional and umbrella.  Were thrilled to get the great pricing on our items and scheduled the delivery for Sunday, two days later.

We got the reminder call on Saturday and the pre-call on Sunday morning that our furniture was on schedule.  We were thrilled!  Once the delivery arrived, our hopes for a great experience went out the window!  They neglected to bring the four chairs that came with the set.  Sure enough, they weren't listed on the delivery invoice either. 5 star on the delivery guys professionalism, setup and cleanup.  Negative stars for the warehouse ""pick"" crew for missing our chairs.

We called Customer Service and found out that the chairs were at the warehouse and we could either reschedule another delivery, next week, or pick them up ourselves.  We chose to pickup.

The warehouse is just north of Kyrene and Elliott a couple of blocks.  Once we got there, Mike confirmed they had the chairs and of course they were too big for our vehicle. Great!

Aimee came by to check on us and I explained that this morning's delivery neglected to bring our chairs.  She checked on her delivery trucks and spoke with their third party delivery company and got us setup to be delivered right now.  Josh, who owns the third party delivery company, delivered our chairs himself.  

Sales Staff -  5 stars
Delivery Staff - 5 stars
Pick Staff - Negative stars for forgetting our four chairs
Warehouse Staff - 5 stars for making up for the issue with the pick staff!

Our full experience was a positive one due to the customer service of Aimee, Mike and Josh, thanks!",1,2
6,"Complimentary charging stations that can't charge my phone.
Tables at the waiting areas can use a clean up.

Service advisor A.... was very friendly and kind.

I waited 2.5 hr for an oil change and when I called and asked how much longer they told me 20 mins. Since it was 20 mins and I finished dinner I figured by the time I'm back at the dealership half the wait time would of been gone. 

Guess what my car sat there untouched when my advisor LIED to me when he told me they are working on it and it'd be 20 mins to completion. 

Arrived in front of the advisors desk and literally after 5 mins then my car was taken in for my oil change. 

Not sure if I had to wait till 8:30 to pick up my car so that's why my oil change was complimentary or if it's because it's my first oil change that's why it's a complimentary. But still I had to wait from 5:30-8:30 just for 1 oil change. Tell me if this is not ridiculous to you or not.

0,"It's fun, good, and BIG... so bring your appetite.

Serendipity is perfect for sharing and has a very fun dining environment.  Seriously, from the decor, to the menu, to the food... everything is just completely oversized.  It's pink, white, and extremely playful so it's definitely worth visiting for those who have children, especially little girls; my daughter loves this place;)  

The prices are a reflection of the portions you get, so you don't feel ripped off.  I would highly recommend coming with a large group so that you can all share and get a nice selection.  Majority of the food are all American trademarks- hotdogs, hamburgers, sandwiches, nachos, but with a serendipity twist.  Don't forget the frozen hot chocolate!  Its exactly as it sounds.  A ""frozen"" (extra cold) hot chocolate topped with whip cream!  Like the other dishes its also oversized and a tad bit too sweet for my buds.  I shared it with three other adults and still had some left over, but my 7 y/o didn't have much trouble having one to herself! :) 

This place gets pretty packed cause a lot of tourists make it a point to stop by.  Night or day, every time I went I always had to wait a little.  They have a to-go area so that's nice if you just want to satisfy your sweet tooth real quick.  There's plenty of seating outside so those who order from the little window are not without somewhere to sit.

7,"3.5 stars; I really want to round up to 4, but just can't do it.  Loved the atmosphere and service, even loved a couple dishes, but not enough to round up.  I had high hopes and, sadly, RM didn't deliver.

We dined upstairs and started in the lounge with some champagne and oysters.  The GM, Paul, was very friendly and chatted us up right away.  He came back to check on us a bit more as we enjoyed our nibbles.  While I have no doubt that he is a friendly, nice guy, I'm sure another reason he spent so much time with us was the lack of customers elsewhere in the restaurant (for the most part, anyway).  

The oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty, as expected.  They aren't cheap, for sure.  At 3.75/an oyster, I've never paid more, not at Daniel Boulud and not even at Providence!  The champagne was also a bit pricey at 25 bucks a glass, but prosecco would not have worked.  The lounge is comfortable, but overlooks the throngs of people roaming about Mandalay Bay.  It's a bit jarring to be in such a fine dining atmosphere but to watch the antithesis just outside a window.

We adjourn to our table to begin the tasting menu.  Service was great!  Three different servers worked with us, answered our questions, and maintained the same friendly atmosphere we experienced in the lounge.  I went with the tasting (75) and the wine pairing (55); Jim G. went with the tasting and a drink.  The food:

Grilled Octopus: Sadly, too rubbery and lacking in flavor.  I think I've learned that if I'm not at Osteria Mozza, I'm not ordering octopus.
Steak and Potatoes: Prime Beef Tartare, cornichons, potatoes, and other yummies I can't remember.  The menu says ""untraditional garnish.""  Surprisingly good!  So simple, but well put together and great quality.
Green Eggs and Ham: Andraki Farm Egg, Jamon Serrano, and Asparagus three ways; super yummy!  Interesting flavors and great combinations.  Cute presentation.
Hot and Cold Foie Gras a la Japonne ($15 supplement): Best dish of the night!  On one side of the plate, there was a lush piece of foie gras, seared perfectly, served on top of crispy sushi rice. Heaven.  On the other side, a cold mousse of foie gras nestling underneath a beautiful piece of uni (sea urchin).  Ridiculous. So good. Can I have two?  Actually, it's too rich to eat two, but still.  There was also a palate-cleansing shot type thing that came with it; totally gross!  
We had the Walu and the Alaskan Salmon.  They were ok nothing special, sadly.
We then had the China Pig and Rabbit Trio ($15 supplement).  Also ok; well prepared, but nothing amazing.  The morel risotto that came with the rabbit was very nice though.
For dessert, we had the Irish Car Bomb (Guinness Ice Cream, Bailey's Ice Cream, Beer Suds, and chocolate pop rocks) and the Frozen Strawberry Shortcake Bar (""Nitro Dots,"" marinated strawberries, and spearmint).  The car bomb was good, but more interesting as an idea than as a dessert.  The Strawberry Shortcake Bar was super good!  It tasted like the Good Humor bars many of us had as kids.  I did find it odd that a fine dining establishment was trying to replicate a 75 cent bar we bought from the ice cream man as kids!  It was good though =)

We ended with an interesting tea presentation.  There was a carafe with what looked lime lemongrass on our table.  Water and dry ice was added for a cool effect (literally and figuratively).  The cold tea was tasty and refreshing, particularly after such a filling meal!

Again, great service and innovative cuisine.  However, the tastes didn't quite match up with the ambitions or the prices.  I respect Chef Moonen for only using sustainable fish and for being creative with food, but, for the same price I can have much better food.  Ultimately, that has to be my gauge for my review.",5,6

2,"Arrived at this location on Tuesday August 20th, walking up I noticed all thier kiosk were off, I usually will us them to check in. Went to the business line and was called to the counter by a young lady to be helped. She said they didn't have what I reserved, a full size car. I commented back if you have something else I would take it, she indicated to me that they did and she would talk with the manager. She asked to wait, and pointed down to the end of the counter. As I walked to the area she pointed to, I heard something about a 40 minute wait. There were people sitting and standing everywhere. As I stood there I struck up a conversation with a gentleman standing there. I commented about a 40 minute wait, he said he had been there over and hour already. At this point 25 minutes waiting, where I was now standing a person from Avis was walking by, I asked her if they had any cars, she said yes.

I walked back to the counter, (now mind you in 30 minutes of standing they called 3 people) to  with who I believe was the manager, Alec. As I walked up 3 customers were talking with him, he was really getting rude, 2 said cancel my reservation and the other, couldn't understand my they didn't have cars. On the counter were the little contracts they give you, there must have been 50 ( so 30 minutes they gave out 3 cars, that's 6 cars and hour, 5 hour wait, not 40 minutes). I talked with the manager, he tried to get rude with me I asked not to take that tone with me. I cancelled my reservation walked next door to Avis and picked a car up.

We are a very large corporation and have our own in house travel agency. The reason I bring this up is, I usually don't get involved with the his, but this is not the first Enterprise has not had what I reserved. I personally called their customer service and got the run around, how about free rental days. I already have several, that doesn't fix a problem. I was transferred to a supervisor and Corporate will call you,that has not happened.

I'm sure from this post, I will get their standard reply. The cool( for lack of a better word)thing about me, I'm in a position with the company that I can do this - I told my travel department NEVER to use Enterprise again and sent out a memo (1600 employee's) not to use Enterprise.

When I call the office no one can take my call because everyone is in a ""training meeting"". I was told I would be called back after the weekend. No one called me back, I had to call for over a week before some one would talk with me. Mind you they have already accepted the Government contract so I'm already a paying customer. I finally get someone and the excuse I got was ""the surveyor quit"". I had to take a day off of work for a company that doesn't even have the courtesy to call and say they wont make the appointment. When I do get a surveyor out he doesn't report the fact I have two tools boxes, two large steel tool cabinets, a Harley, a fridge and a work table. He also said that the car parts would be fine and they would ship it. When the movers show up they were told I had only 13 thousand pounds of stuff, In reality I had nearly 20k pounds. The packers were not told of the stuff in the garage and didn't bring enough boxes or supplies. They then told me they wouldn't pack the car parts. When I showed them the government form that spells out all the car parts and the fact they accepted the form and therefore the parts they started to argue with me. I had to call the government office who deals with this contract and they said its allowed and would ship. After a week they went back on their word and told me they would not take the parts. This was less than a week before I had to move and was left scrambling to find a way to ship them. All of this is after Kara Jones from AAction movers told me they would ship it, twice. They also did not finish packing my house on the last day and left without packing a fish tank which needed a special crate.

For the Orleans, you can book online on Fandango as well. However, there's going to be a online booking fee .. I believe it's like $1.25 per ticket, which isn't bad unless you want to drive yourself to the theatre just to buy tickets.

Never heard of it though I'm not a fisherman.  It was the most expensive nigiri on the menu so we ordered it to see what it was about.  It was drowned in a ponzu sauce so not sure about the taste.  It was white, seemed like it was cooked(?), and it was...different.  The next day, after my friend had the shits, we googled white tuna.  Yikes.  Not sure which on ewe got but it wasn't good.  I was ok but I have an Andrew Zimmern stomach.  Probably won't return but if I did, I'd stick to the salmon skin rolls.",0,0
0,"8/10 compared with the real authentic Szechuan cruisine, but 10/10 for what you can find in Charlotte or the U.S. I ordered more than my husband and I could eat so I could have a better idea how good this restaurant is. 回锅肉，夫妻肺片，水煮牛肉are all very decent. The small dishes are just ok. Soup dumplings are not very soupy/juicy, and lack for some flavor. Pan fried buns 生煎包 are unlike anything I had in Shanghai. BUT I will go back there for Szechuan food for sure!!!",0,0
0,"This used to be my go-to place for my favorite, the Al Pastor burrito. I would get each of my kids a kids meal, and everyone was happy. I came there so much that the older lady at the front (I believe part of the husband / wife team that owns this place) knew I wanted an Al Pastor before I could even say what I wanted. I liked that. The husband was usually on the grille, and all was well, other than prices being a bit high (which the food was good enough to justify at the time). 

Then every time I went I started seeing new faces on the grille and the almost $8 Al Pastor burritos got smaller, and smaller, and smaller. The last time I went I was pretty upset to get a burrito that was 2"" thick (or a touch less) for $8, and I let the young lady at the front counter know that I would not be back, because I wasn't getting my money's worth, after showing her how small the Burrito was. Her response? ""Sorry"". No offer to remake the food or do anything to make things right for a long time loyal customer.

I agree with the description of Rat S. of Ricardo's portions these days, ""measly"" is the perfect word. Honestly they have the smallest burritos in town right now for the money, and they need to make some changes...too much money for too little. 

Otherwise, if you don't mind paying a lot for a little, the food is good, the place is clean, and the the salsa bar is good. Wasted potential at this point in my view, but there is a 100% honest review from someone who had been going there for years but will probably not return.",0,0

First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch.",0,0

23,"This place is a reason for a Zero star review! 
(I never thought I would say this!)

There is one thing that a consumer should never have to deal with and that is outright lies.  I am not sure where Enterprise found their staff who handled our reservation but he obviously should not be dealing with customers.  I can tolerate poor service and even rude service and still find something positive to say.  But when I am repeatedly lied to, that is where I draw the line. 

We made a reservation on line with all the particulars, but when we got here the gentleman we were dealing with kept trying to add more and more things on to what we ordered.  It was bizarre because it was almost as if he didn't even have our reservation!

We listened to each additional fee he offered and said ""no"", this included a ""no"" to the fuel charge.  He later adds an additional fee and tells us that it is ""something that the company adds on and I really don't have any idea what it's for.""  We both were becoming frustrated at this point.  

I have heard a lot of nonsense from unethical sales representatives but this really was one of the most lame.  Also, please don't smile when you're lying to us and trying to steal my money! It is unethical, creepy, unprofessional and rude!

What makes the whole situation worse was he had a very negative attitude. It was as if he had to strain to get every sentence out of his mouth but still had enough strength to add a sigh at the end of each sentence. He did not seem happy with his job at all! 

When he finished explaining everything we asked him to once again explain the additional charge.  Again, we got the same answer.  We just figured we would check with the other service representative who is there when we pick up the car. 

The person at the desk LIED and actually charged us the fuel fee, that was the unknown fee he was talking about.  I'm not sure why he felt the need to do this, maybe because it was late at night and we were very tired and he thought he could get away with it... I don't know.  Maybe he's not a nice person. 

I personally wanted to go back in and ask him why he did this but I did not want to begin my trip on a sour note. 

Enterprise, when we say that we do not want the additional fuel fee that's what we mean.  Do not attempt to sneak it in our bill and try to explain it as something else.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.  We have never had an experience like this while renting cars where we were talked down to, lied to and you almost STOLE our money!",14,15

I told them I had to have it ready on a Friday morning at 8am since I was leaving town for our wedding. They called me Friday  morning at 7am asking how late they could keep working on the dress because they were running behind. So as I was on my way to airport I picked up my dress only to try it on later to find it was completely ruined.

2,"We stayed here for a week via a RCI timeshare trade and overall it was great.  Our unit was very clean, well appointed and for the most part quiet (except for one evening when an elephant upstairs dropped a safe or something).  There is a full kitchen with dishwasher (+soap), full size washer & dryer (with soap / fabric softener for 1 load), and a ginormous tub/shower combo that is big enough for even a heavy set couple to share a bubble bath *nothing to see here, move along, move along*  Bath & Bodyworks shampoo and lotion in the bathtub, but a bar of soap for the sink.  (I bought some cheap liquid soap from the Target a mile or so away).

They have large flat screen TVs in the living room and the bedroom so we got to enjoy our ubiquitous hours of HGTV that we always like to have when on vacation, as a break from the casinos and shows.  Bedroom furnishings are on the ornate side.  There is a large walk-in closet and a safe, and the drapes in the bedroom do an EXCELLENT job of keeping the light out.

My biggest complaint about the unit is that the mattress wasn't very comfortable.  I've slept on worse, but I've also slept on better.  A minor complaint is that the A/C worked better in the living room than bedroom -- it was cooler on my honey's side of the bed than mine :(  But, not so much that we couldn't sleep - it was just a hair too hot.   My only other very minor complaint is that the staff kept trying to call us, they would ring us about twice a day (at least, and unfortunately usually when we were trying to sleep), presumably to try to get us to come to a timeshare presentation that we had no intention of attending, so we finally just unplugged the phones.  How do I know it was the staff since I never answered?  Because we have cell phones and we didn't tell ANYONE where we were staying so anyone who legitimately needed to talk to us would have called our cell. And, we know how time shares work... we've been around the block a few times.

Amenities that they have that we didn't take advantage of include regular shuttles downtown, to various strip locations and to the Rio.  We rented a car so we didn't need them.  They also have a restaurant, marketplace and pool area none of which we visited.

They have 24 hour security at the gate, and probably the friendliest security guards ever - they always smile and wave when you drive in, assuming you have your giganto parking pass on the dash.  If you don't they do actually ask you to stop and check a list of names to be sure you should be there.  So we felt pretty secure.

Parking is covered, a VERY nice touch in 106+ degree Vegas.  And parking is free.

If the mattresses were more comfy I'd have given them 5* but I'll give them a solid 4.5.  The couch in our unit was a little worse for wear too but only aesthetically, it was perfectly functional.  I'd stay there again if I didn't want to stay on the strip so I could safely lush it up but I'd probably invest in an egg-crate pad or something to go over the mattress.",1,0

0,"This company is an absolute disaster, and the Internet service is horrible!  The only reason I gave it even one star is because 0 is not an option.  Two words describe what you can expect from their internet service ... CONSTANT BUFFERING!  As for the customer service, it is non-existent.  The billing is even worse. They make it nearly impossible to cancel services too. You can't cancel online, and you can't get through on the phone to cancel without waiting for a LOOOOONG time and then arguing with a service rep!  I have lived in or around 6 big cities in the US over the years, and I've never experienced service and customer service as laughably horrible as Century Link's. The internet service is SLLOOOOOWW, and you can't stream a movie or show unless you have time and patience for 2 minutes of buffering every 30 seconds. No lie - constant buffering!!  It is literally like having dial-up TV and internet minus the screeches and hums of the old modems.  Oh!  Speaking of the modem ... we purchased a CenturyLink modem over the phone at the time of setup. Somehow that purchase went through Best Buy, but nonetheless we got the modem that CenturyLink ordered for us. So when I called and spoke with not just 1 but 4 - 4! - service reps, the last guy (Paulo) blamed the modem for the horrible performance and said I bought the wrong modem (that they charged me for twice ). So after I pointed out that CenturyLink ordered the modem for me, he said ""Oh, yes, I see that here now"". Then he offered me a new, ""better"" free modem if I didn't cancel. He didn't have a reply when I asked why they didn't send me the better modem to begin wNeedless to say, I cancelled and switched companies.  To recap: IT IS AWFUL!  Go to ANY OTHER company!! 

UPDATE: Since the last review and my conversations with CenturyLink, who said they removed the charges ....I've received 2 more bills for the modem that I already paid for, and they billed me for WiFi service for the month AFTER I canceled my service. Simply. Amazing. Worst company I've ever dealt with .....",0,0

The store wasn't busy and there was only one person in front of me. When I got up to order, I gave the cashier, Alexia, my coffee order and got a chocolate chip muffin. She informed me that the store's oven was broken so my muffin couldn't be heated up (not a big deal) but why hasn't it been fixed?

Everyone is super friendly and really make it a welcoming and fun environment to work out in. The classes are challenging for all levels of fitness. Tony's kettlebell class is a highlight! I've worked out with a few of the trainers and they are amazing! They motivate, inspire and encourage their clients to reach their goals. The gym is also very competitively priced which is very difficult to find in the area. 
One of the biggest reasons I love the gym so much is there childcare facility. 
System Fitness has some of the best childcare professionals working at their gym- most of them have an extensive background in ECE and/or have kids of their own. 
The daycare has gone above and beyond on more than one occasion to accommodate my needs.
 Alicia and her team genuinely care about the kids and are nurturing and attentive. They come up with different and fun learning activities for the kids to do everyday (ie. arts and crafts).

Happy hour is everyday before 8 pm, a pint will cost you just under 5$.

I've never tried the food here but if you're hungry there's your typical bar menu, appetizers like wings and nachos, sandwiches and quesadillas.

The positives:
- The bagels were delicious and just like back east! 
- Our server was very friendly and attentive
- Their deli counter was very impressive, and provided a lot of to-go options
- Their portion size was very generous and we ended up taking a good bit of our fish platter home
- They started us off with some bagel chips and pineapple/coconut cream cheese which was excellent

The Negatives:
- They were very rigid as far as the menu went.  The waiter had to check and make sure they could do certain things.  This sometimes is a red flag.  I am the customer, charge me more if you have to, but give me what I want!
- We got a slice of banana cream cake and a frosted cookie (free with a yelp check-in).  The cake was just ok, and the cookie was almost tasteless

Recently went to the NE location to look at a replacement for my GE pair that just can't do the job anymore.  
#1 - there were about 5 salespeople, but they were all on the phone.  So, I went to the counter and asked if I could get some help.  One guy finally peeled the phone away from his ear and asked what I wanted, kind of rudely too.  Sorry to interrrup your 1-900 phone call.

I have had the same barber for the past two years.  I moved to Champaign and used yelp to find a new one.  After my haircut, I noticed that all the great reviews for this place are from a few years back...big mistake on my part.

Now I am sure that every barber in the shop is different, but mine was horrible.  I walked in and was seated right away.  He asked me what we were looking for today, and I replied.. ""just a trim"".  I also explained that I like it a bit shorter, and my wife likes it longer.  I also explained that I style my hair with a side-part.

He broke out the clippers and proceeded to give me basically a high and tight fade.  My hair is so short now that it cannot be parted.  I have several fun cowlicks, and they are now all running my life again.  All of the ""edges"" in my hair are crooked, with odd chunks taken out in random places.

I generally prefer the older barbers, as they usually take their time and will talk a little.  They also tend to not use clippers as much, in my experience.  This guy did not say one word to me the entire time I was in the chair.  He used the clippers for 95% of my cut, and destroyed my head in the process.

$18 for a good haircut is fine by me, but this was by far the worst I have received.  I walked out really mad at myself for not just going to Walmart for the same quality.  I will not be back, and I will do my best to stop people from using this establishment.

One of my favorites was their cauliflower.   It was lightly breaded, crisp, and perfectly seasoned.    Now, the portion is smaller, and the cauliflower is rubbery.    What's fun about that?

I could cite other details, but everything pretty much follows the same theme:  Smaller Portions.   Lesser Quality.    A business model that is pretty hard to understand with the out-of-the-gate popularity of the place.",0,0
4,"Something to be said about the food. I dined here this evening 12/19 and was wondering what all the hype was about. The food is what the hype was about. I enjoyed with the table the buratta, prosciutto, and octopus apps. All fantastic those were. Entrees included mustard crusted rack of lamb and lobster ravioli which were both to die for. Dessert I had the molten lava cake which was good as expected. 

Now for what was to be desired was the service. We were seated promptly and the wait staff at first was very helpful in letting us know about the restaurant. We had our reservation for 5:00pm and failed to realize on how much the service standard declined when they were busy. The entire dinner took almost 2 1/2 hours as a result. We placed out order apps took around 20-25 min then entrees around 45-50 min. I actually caught myself checking the time on how long it had been since we had placed our order. The only other thing I noticed is that when the place got busy our waiter seemed to disappear. I waited for 20 min for my drink to be refilled and then the last time I asked for a refill they didn't even bring it back by the time I left 20 min later. 
Point: Food is good as I expected it to be. The kitchen is doing it right. The FOH however has left little to be desired. This is the reason for the 3 stars.",1,1
0,The only reason I gave it a 3 and not a 4 is because I mean come on it's fast food.  I got the gyro combo and they actually heated the meat up on the griddle.  The food was really good and they even have feta as a cheese choice on the bar.  I was very impressed.,0,0
1,"*Note: I made this post December 2014, but thought I had already posted it at the time when I hadn't.*

If this review was solely on food, it would honestly be three stars. I don't know if it was just me and my taste buds that night, but, everything tasted ""meh""; the first bite out of everything tasted good, but then every bite after that tasted kind of mediocre. 

My family and I had dinner here and started with the Bang Bang Shrimp and Ahi Tuna Sashimi. The Bang Bang Shrimp is pretty okay, a good mix of flavors. The Ahi Tuna was okay as well. For our main courses we had Cold Water Lobster Tails and the Fontina Chop. The Lobster Tails were ok, every bite was as delicious as the last, contrary to the majority of my meal. However, the lobsters were plain with no seasoning or special flavoring; there are however, lemons and melted butter given on the side (along with a side of your choice: rice, mashed potatoes, etc.). When my Mother cooks Lobsters for dinner, she cooks them with a special sauce; making her lobsters extremely delicious with the seasoning and sauce being present through every bite. I'm mentioning this, due to the fact that, it may factor to why I see the lobsters as plain. Moving on, the Fontina Chop, was pretty good. Although, like I said, every bite after the first tasted mediocre to me.",1,1

The AYCE option is quite cheap $11.99 lunch/ $17.99 dinner.The fish was fresh and of standard quality, the hot food arrived hot and tasted yummy, the maki was substandard as is all too common @AYCE sushi in Toronto. The cold service I received by the waitresses here upon multiple visits with different parties including once with friends, once with family, and a couple times alone were equally as off-putting as the next.

5,"Benny Fierro's is a chain of pizza shops from Virginia who has recently opened up a location on the bad pizza gauntlet known as East Carson Street.  You probably won't recognize the name Benny Fierro's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic Italian mobster last name.  This place is definitely new and it shows..I tried to call in an order but ""the ringer was broken"".  When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs...on one side there is a huge mural or what if I can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal, I an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad.  On the other wall they seem to be going with the random antique/tin sign on the wall motif...the cross country skis and canoe must be on back order.  

When browsing the menu at Benny Hoffa's a certain question comes to mind which is ""where is the menu?"" There is no menu because Benny only offers pizza...which only comes in one size...which is comically over-sized....cut in 8.....which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie.  Unfortunately this is a gimmick pizza shop, which is a shame because the pizza is actually pretty close to being good were it not so terribly inconvenient. 


The pizzas at Benny Bagadonuts are made in a brick deck oven but unfortunately they use screens underneath them while cooking so the dough ends up a bit raw in spots underneath the sauce. The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can't really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half. At about halfway up the slice the dough starts to even out to an appropriate amount.  The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat...I almost didn't eat the crust, which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza. The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle wasn't as thin, the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust.  The sauce was somewhat ample and distributed pretty well across the pie as well.  The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer and was still pretty soft on the bottom.  If they didn't insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything. 


One thing that stands out about the pizza here is the dough, which I think has a lot more fat in it than most Pittsburgh shops.  Benny Buttafuoco's dough has a nice bready fatty salty taste to it which helps it achieve some sort of crunch despite being made on screens.  I'm not sure if they are using shortening, butter, lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here. The dough has a somewhat medium density, not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly.  I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but I can't imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel (or a peel that big even existing).  In general the dough has a great taste with a mediocre consistency.  

I think Benny is using mostly mozzarella cheese although it almost tastes like there is a hint of muenster in there too.  The cheese is high quality and melts well without charring.

Benny Mascarpone's sauce is fine.  They are using decent tomatoes and the consistency is a medium thickness which is pretty desirable for me.  The taste is slightly one dimensional...and the dimension is garlic.  It's not an offensive amount of garlic I just wish that I could taste the tomatoes more.  There seems to be some herbs in there too but the garlic is taking over.  



In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and I will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify its own ridiculousness.  Pizza is supposed to be easy, convenient and cheap...you aren't supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door, somewhere along the way Benny Lemonjello forgot that.  This place is a fun gimmick for drunk people who want to marvel over an excessively large slice of pizza.  The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses, only to drunks. If they would take the same ingredients and offer an 18' pie it would taste much much better than the pie they make now because it would be made better and would cook the whole way.  E. Carson Street has seen shops with better pizza than this close (pizza sola for example) so if Benny Piscopo wants to make it in this city he is going to have to step his game up.  


Overall Rating: 6.5 out of 10",2,0
0,"I'm kind of a matcha addict, so when my friend told me about this place I had to check it out.
We were smart and went on an off hour (right at 12:20pm). We definitely beat the rush because on our way our we already saw a small line forming. Be aware that you'll most likely be enjoying your treat outside because seating is especially limited, totaling maybe 4 tables.

So here the nitty gritty of it.

I ordered the Tsujiri sundae. One of my first complaints, that seems to be the same of others was the pricing. I paid about $8.50 for this baby. That's about equivalent to 4 sundaes at McDonalds. So the question is, was it worth $8.50? I mean I guess you could justify that its the price of the ""high quality matcha"" but I highly doubt it works out to be that much. So to answer the question simply. No, it is not worth $8.50. The toppings are some rice balls, some over sweet red bean probably from a can and a little bit of corn cereal crunch on the bottom, which I actually wasn't a huge fan of, texturally and taste-wise. 

So you ask, what did I like? I liked the actual matcha soft serve itself, no toppings, nada. So stick to your staples, simple is definitely the way to go. Especially if you don't like things too sweet. I personally prefer matcha minimally sweetened because I actually like the bitter taste. 

Another improvement I think they could make is having descriptions of the items on the menu. I understand that its japanese and unique and all crazy and stuff, but honestly - they are forgetting the fact that they are in Toronto, regardless if they are located in the self proclaimed neighbourhood of ""Little Japan"", Descriptions are necessary, considering that when the staff is asked they aren't very enthusiastic about it, neither are they very clear. Its honestly quite hard to hear through the thick accent and muffled voice. So my friend and I just ordered on the fly. 

All in all - I can say that I've been, and I would probably go again, but I wouldn't hesitate to turn around if I saw a line of more than 10 people. And I'm also sticking with the basics next time and ordering a plain matcha soft serve.",1,0

10,"Off Da Hook Soul Food is a solid 3 to 3.5 stars but I will upgrade them to 4 stars based on the exceptional service we received. Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The same thing holds true for places to eat and that includes this place.  They are a very small ""hole in the wall"" kind of dinner.  If you blink twice while driving past them you may miss them.  They are a nice alternative to the usual dinner's in Phoenix. 

They offer some of the basic Soul Food options with almost everything fried of course ~ pork chops, catfish, chicken.  No oxtail, rabbit, ham hocks or chitlins though.  Not that I order chitlins but it's hard to beat good rabbit and ham hocks when dinning at a Soul food place!  They offer some of the more popular Soul food types of sides such as collard greens, mac-n-cheese, yams, beans & rice, cabbage, and some others.  However they don't offer fried or cooked okra or turnips, which are Soul food staples.  Corn bread comes with your meal and they offer Kool Aide in addition to soda and tea.

I had the fried Pork Chops with sides of mac-n-cheese and red beads in rice.  The breading on the Pork Chop was DELISH! It had a lot of crunch, with an excellent balance of seasoning that was ""finger licking good"".  The sides were ok, nothing special but good.  I wanted their Collard Greens, but they weren't ready which was unfortunate ~ maybe next time. 

We also had their fried chicken and waffles.  WOWsers!  The fried chicken had the same or similar breading as did the Pork Chop.  The chicken was fried to almost  perfection and their Waffle had an great taste that wasn't too heavy and complimented the fried chicken very well.  Look out LoLo's!!  This place is just as good if not better!",5,5

1,"Lunch at Honey Bears BBQ today. Arrived at 11:15 with four parties seated and three in line in front of me - good sign. 

I ordered the BBQ pork, hot link, a side of slaw and a drink. He changed it to the # 1 value meal to save me money but it still came to $10.28. 

Meal arrived in about 4 minutes and everything was hot but I was disappointed in most of it. Come slaw first: slaw was tangy, perfect spice and mayo level. Definitely would order again. 

The pork and link came together in a HB bun. I got 2-3 ounces of pork and a three-inch link. Decent flavor but for $10, I should get more than 2-3 oz.

The link was good. It had good snap, excellent spice but just not much of it. 
The meal came with a pint of BBQ sauce which was unexpected. The sauce had a slight amount of spice but was so sweet I couldn't put much on the Sammie. I suppose when you're called Honey BBQ, you make sweet sauce. 

Around the corner is Hap's BBQ which I thought was better but Famous Dave's blows them both out with flavor and value.",0,0

Well the interior fit my expectations. Mmmm grungy. But I understand people are into that, and really, who cares? It's about the affordable booze! And yes, this place hits the mark with booze. Food... Well that's meh. But who comes to a cheap place for food?

Ah... Thank you for thrusting the menus into my hands and randomly motioning me to a general direction. Oh and thanks for giving my date a pair of utensils and me none. Surly attitude? Hot!

But trying in such a way that it was evident that his ambitions had already been crushed by his coworkers uncaring attitudes.

My mom and I stopped in here for lunch before the Bat Out of Hell Musical. It's a nice little spot and a good atmosphere; very...chill, relaxed.

Both were great; but I love caesar salad and this one had the right amount of dressing that was creamy and tart. Shaved parmesan not that sprinkly stuff. And bacon bits. So good.

2,"The ACC is a premiere venue for events here in the city, home of the Raptors and Leafs and for a lot of big production concerts. I've attended numerous events here and each has been very well done. 

Before my first visit here I kept hearing that ""there is no bad seat"" at the ACC. And after having a chance to sit all the way at the top row to almost court side (for a Universities basketball game...not a ballin Raptors game I should say) I have to agree with the statement, in comparison to a live theater venue, Massey Hall or the Rogers Centre, the top rows here offer a far better relative view of the event. Although on average tickets for events here are much higher than at some of those other events. 

It's located in an extremely convenient area very easily accessible by TTC, GO or even Via (if you are planning on travelling far to get here) as there is a direct connection from here to Union station. But as with any venue crowds are a big factor, for a Raptors game that starts at 7, prepare to get to the gate at 6:30 for 300 seating if you want enough time for the washroom/food/drinks before tip off. 

Food options are good at any level, the 300 level have a very large bar area that usually has shorter lines than the typical kiosk, but a large beer costs $15 and a pizza slice around $4 so I don't know if you want to spend over $20 on beer and pizza. You could always visit the Tim Hortons on the 1st floor. 

Washrooms are clean, stair ways don't get too clogged up when exiting and the staff I have found are friendly and helpful. 

Cup holders on seats would be nice since foot space is limited but they do have in seat service on the lower bowls which delivers on the taste front. The jumbotron is not that large but it gets the job done, lighting and sound is good quality so you're unlikely to feel like you're missing out on loud sound experiences. 

It's not a perfect venue by any means but it's new enough to look nice and with recent improvements to their food options the ACC gets a solid 3.5 - 4 stars from me.",1,0

If you balk at this newly discounted price and threaten to leave, you will be given another discount.  But wait, there's more.  When you go ahead with the procedure, because, golly, it would go against their standards to do the regular cleaning you've bought and paid for, you will get ANOTHER price when it's time to pay!  Please check this price as it will include, ""hygienist Instruction"", which is the for the time and effort she spent talking you into the outrageously expensive deep cleaning.

We arrived, and the iconic escalator was completely torn apart. There was a new option to walk a trail up the steep hill which is a nice addition. The park was the most empty I have ever seen. The animals all looked sad and bored. We tried to see the scheduled events for the day, but none of them happened.

2,"I was really impressed with Primarily Prime Rib.  My Mom and I were skeptical and thought that we would have just a typical casino cafe prime rib meal.  Boy were we wrong!

The restaurant is located upstairs, next door to a Mexican restaurant and also near a small bar (which I never knew was there - you learn something new every day!).  We did not have a reservation, and the hostess was very friendly and was able to seat us immediately.

The restaurant was larger than I expected, but not huge.  It is dimly lit, with booths surrounding the outer edge and tables inside, with booths on the inner edge as well.  

It only took us 2 seconds to decide what we wanted to order, so when our server came to take our drink order, we advised him that we were ready to order our food as well.  We both ordered the same cut of meat - the South Point cut.  It is $15.99 and comes with a choice of soup or salad and choice of mashed potato, baked potato or rice pilaf.

My salad (and my Mom's soup) came out quickly.  The best part about the service is that everything is brought out on a cart.  The salad was tossed table side, which I thought was a nice touch.  My Mom's soup was split pea and was REALLY good.  It was creamy and smooth and super delicious.  The bread basket was nothing to write home about, but who cares?!

There was not much of a delay between our salad and entree, which was good.  Once again, our dishes were brought out on a cart.  I like that the meat is served on it's own plate, swimming in the au jus, rather than serving a seperate cup.  I had the rice pilaf, which I thought was really good.  It wasn't dry and was seasoned really well.  My meat was medium rare and just bloody enough, and was very juicy.  My Mom had a baked potato, which they prepared tableside.  I thought that was a really nice touch.

It took us quite awhile to get our check, but other than that, it was a great meal.  We were really impressed by the tableside service and rolling carts and the overall quality of the meal.  I will definitely be back.  Including tip, it was just about $40 for our meal.  Considering all that we got, the ambiance and the amazing service, I think that is a steal!  This is a real hidden gem in Henderson!",0,0

3,"I was ecstatic to step foot into my all time favorite chef's restaurant for the first time. Heard amazing reviews about this place... the place is aesthetically pleasing. So to start we got their buffalo chicken wings for the appetizer.. which was okay.. very average... then our entrees came along which was a filet mignon, a prime dry aged NY strip steak with a side of potato purée.. first off, the 8oz filet mignon was barely the size of my palm... it was the tiniest steak I've ever seen... secondly, our steaks were suppose to be cooked medium but it ended up being very well done. They mixed up our orders with the table across from us. Without being said, my boyfriend switched his order of mignon to the NY Strip I had. Once they brought us our ""medium"" steaks it was still ridiculously dry. Then after tasting the steak.. we dipped our tongue into the potato purée which looked extremely creamy and heavenly.... but guess what?! There was a piece of plastic found inside of our dish! The waitress was extremely kind and gave us  ~50/60% off for all the inconveniences that occurred. I'm the one to pay and tip generously.. even though everything should have been free.. waiting for the chefs to remake my food a thousand times. Overall.. It was BLOODY HELL.",3,1

4,"Okay so I didn't have a great experience with a previous nail salon AND I found this nail spot solely from our fellow Yelpers :) (thank you, btw) 

So, I went in last night because I've been wanting to get a pedicure. I walked in the door at 701pm. I was immediately greeted, asked to pick a color, the nail tech was already prepping my foot bath with the salts. I was seated and attended to in all of a minute and half!!! What?!! (Already SOLD at that point...)

No comparison to the last nail salon... AND this place had five other ladies in there, two others getting pedis, the rest fills or full sets. Yep... 

Now, I know the techs were all tired and wanting to get out of there, but my tech was still pleasant. She soaked my feet, removed my polish, scrubbed them, wiped, clipped them. She used a dremol to smooth out the tops of my nails, cleaned up my cuticles, removed any ingrown nails, smoothed the skin around my toes, filed the edges of my nails, did a callous shindig, rubbed them. She also gave me a brief massage on my calves, ankles, feet, and toes...AND placed a hot towel over my feet... YEAH! Okay, so maybe they don't do all the fancy whatever, whatever...BUT, I totally am a fan! They were quick, polite, some small talk with Sung, my tech :)  think I'm going to become a regular here. I was in at 701, out by 729pm. Pedicure $17.  
Nuff said. LOL. 

Next trip will be gel manicure $25, I was told ;) Next pedi will be French tip per my regular this time just wanted a fun, bright pink shade ;) I was told $20 is the cost of that.

6,"Came during grand opening period and received a fresh burger on the house.

It was a 4 oz patty, with tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, cheese, and onions. The burger was quite small. Taste was alright, not too greasy. Wasn't too impressed with the lettuce; I like it when it's just a huge leaf rather than the sliced up ones you get from those salad bags. Definitely feels healthier than a lot of other burger places though, and the texture of the meat feels like meat.

We also ordered a poutine. It came in a small styrofoam container. Cheese curds were nice and chewy, though the gravy was a bit too salty.

Overall, it's not a bad option if you're craving burgers and looking for one that's not too heavy.",2,6

The food was ready in less than 10 min which was great. I'd really been in the mood for some amazing Greek salad.... But I'll be honest: it wasn't that great. There didn't seem to be much meat on the salad, and I didn't particularly care for the OO dressing, so I was glad I got a different one to try. This salad was quite bland, and didn't seem authentic. However, the meat was tasty. Grilled nicely and flavorful, just sparse. The pita bread was good, so I can say that it wasn't a complete fail. I just won't return, or if I do, I won't be getting another Greek salad.",0,0

There are always kids running up and down the steps on both sides of our building say they are playing tag.

It's over priced for what you get. It was filthy when we moved in and our microwave and dishwasher half works. Scariest part is we have a baby due in the next two week and we are stuck here for another 5 and 1/2 months. We had to fuss about the gate not being shut all the time. They did fix that but the lady in the office wasn't happy to do so. The only helpful person here is Quan. But don't be fooled by the model apartments. This place isn't the place to be.,0,0

The second TSA slammed my bag down so hard she broke the screen protector on my Kindle. Apparently, something triggered the X-ray, but no explanation was provided.

I've spent the last one month emailing and phoning almost daily and they have yet to resolved these issues. Their customer service: when you do get someone on the phone, the standard answer is: ""yes, we'll see how to resolve this and phone you back"" ... LIES because no one  phones back. They simply do not care about resolving the issue or delivering on their promises or keeping their customers satisfied. My take on this is they're a completely dysfunctional organization, where there is no communication between staff and departments, and they simply do not care about producing decent results.The manager of customer service (yes, you, Saad) is just an much a joke as anyone else.

Think about it ... this is a company where the staff only give out their first name, never their last name. Why is this? I wouldn't be surprised if irate customers have tried to hunt them down after work hours to get their print jobs done.",0,0
3,"It is true that it is hard to get an appointment with Dr. Chambers and that the wait times are long. It can be frustrating to say the least....BUT 

- I came to Dr. Chambers with a whole host of problems. I'm a few years out from cervical cancer but still suffered with debilitating pain every month a few days before and during my cycle. I have visited **16** obgyn's before Dr. Chambers and have had to endure countless invasive procedures, medications, surgeries, being told it was in my head, being belittled and shamed by obgyn's, having my husband be asked IN FRONT OF ME if I was crazy...you name it.

Dr. Chambers listened and took me seriously. No other Dr had. Turns out I had undiagnosed PID for 22 YEARS. He also looked at my hormone levels and found I was seriously lacking some of them. He was not afraid to ask me questions about my libido and how my sexual functioning was, which was a relief and made me feel finally heard and validated.

Dr. Chambers cured my PID and got my hormones back in check.

He gave me more than that though. I suffered through so much pain for so long I forgot what it felt like to be normal; to not have to have my life revolve around a week or two a month of pain, to fear every month as that time neared, to fear the cancer might return

He gave me life back.

Had dinner there a few nights ago (on a Wednesday evening) and the service and food left a lot to be desired. 

There was one waiter working an entire room... Which resulted in very spotty and slow service. Especially as the room was almost full. From taking drink orders (15 mins) to clearing dirty dishes on the table next to ours (30 mins) to bringing ketchup (15 mins) everything took forever. 

On top of that, the food left a lot to be desired. There seemed to be issues with the food across the dining room - from the table next to ours receiving poorly shucked oysters to the other table next to ours receiving undercooked chicken. We ordered the flatbread and a burger - the flatbread came out lukewarm. Given the speed of service we didn't even bother to complain.

There is nothing in her Groupon that states new clients only or doesn't apply if you have a lot of hair. I am a teacher, I can't afford to pay close to $200 every couple months for my hair. I just spent almost $300 on a Keratin treatment she did two months ago that only lasted a few weeks. I would think you would try to work with an established client and do what you can for them.

4,"On a Friday night, this Red Robin was super busy as expected. Service was slow, and bottomless fries and salad was intermittent. Our server did bring my son a larger signature lemonade, his favorite, the Poppin' Purple. His Southern Charm was delicious! He had no complaints there. I enjoy the Caesar Salad very much. 

Their rewards program is easy. I had a $4 off $10 reward. All you need to do is sign up with your phone number online. 

I will be back, but this time, I will try a weekday.",2,6
1,"Delicious going in but a disaster coming out.  Be warned, anyone with immune compromised health can become hospitalized from this type of illness. They need to look at the sourcing of their shellfish because multiple people in our party got violently ill 48 hrs after eating there. Vomiting and profuse watery diarrhea. This was likely NOT from improper food handling but from poor food sourcing. Very sad we cannot go back as it was delicious.",0,0

After waiting in line, we finally get to the register to order.  They don't have ostrich.  They don't have boar.  They don't have Kobe.  Really?!  We were very disappointed.  But since we were hungry, we went ahead and ordered an elk burger and a bacon cheeseburger.  When they asked how we wanted them cooked, we both said medium.  After a 15 minute wait, we received our burgers.  They were both very well done.  You get your own condiments in a salad bar style.  Kind of gross as people had their hands all over it, just grabbing things without tongs. Ew.  Beside being overcooked, the burgers were bland.  We were disappointed.  And when you factor in the price, it was definitely not worth it.",0,0
1,"Unpleasant experience. The clinic uses external third party company to book appointments so you're not directly speaking to the office staff. Once you get the direct number to the clinic nobody picks up. My appointment was on a Saturday and the third party only works on mon to friday so you have no way to contact the office on Saturday. You need to make an appointment but they over book your time slot .. had to wait 30+ minutes to see the doctor. Other patients

The hostess staff was rude and dismissive when we were trying find where the rest of our party was. I was really looking forward to the experience and menu items, but even that was a disappointment. The food tasted catered and my filet, which I was unable to give a temperature for was over cooked and tough. I was very disappointed in the entire experience.",0,1
2,"My wife and I were scheduled to meet some friends around 8 on Fremont Street so we we made a dinner reservation at Triple George Grill for 6:45 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated immediately. My wife wanted to sit outside on the patio because it was a beautiful night in the mid 60s. Be aware, that if you sit outside, there is a lot of foot traffic from people walking between The Grand and Fremont Street. Also, Hogs and Heifers is right next door so you're going to hear a lot of hoo-ha from the bar and choppers coming and going. None of that bothered us at all.

Service was very good for the most part from Brian. He was knowledgeable about the menu and answered all questions. Time length between visits increased as he got busier. Our dinner took just under two hours.

Appetizers were a half dozen oysters and the goat cheese marinara. Entrees were the surf and turf special for that night and the fish and chips. And for dessert, the chocolate indulgence.

The warm sourdough bread with butter was delicious. The oysters were served with a nice mignonette which made them enjoyable. The goat cheese marinara was probably our favorite. Creamy, tart goat cheese went well with the marinara and bread. My wife was satisfied but not impressed with her entree. The dessert is recommended for the chocolate lover (they serve it with chocolate ice cream, which is different than some of the older pictures posted).

My entree was not executed as I hoped. I ordered the center cut ribeye with the stuffed lobster ($55). The steak was ordered medium rare and it came out pretty close to medium well, thus a tougher and drier cut of meat. The lobster tail was overcooked leaving not much in the tail but some more tough, dried out meat (see picture).

We'll most likely be back to try other menu items. 15% off entree with Yelp check in.",0,0

0,"I am torn on my review of this place. The ambiance, service and food is excellent (4 star level). However, the portion sizes are sooooo small for the price (2 star level). It comes down to an opinion regarding value for money. If you are able to order without any consideration to price, you are bound for a excellent meal. If you don't like hemorrhage money on a meal, you are going to get a couple nice mouthfuls but plan for another meal nearby right after.

Came on a Saturday night for a double date and we ordered the curry lamb app, HDP salad, the sea bass and the pork belly. The curry lamb and the HDP salad was delicious, but only provided a mouthful of food each. Both the sea bass ($32) and pork belly ($20) were entree level, both were well executed with great flavor. The sea bass was lighter of the two but still fresh and well balanced. However, even at entree level, the dishes were small. I expect to be full after eating a $32 dish but I was still hungry afterwards. Expect to order a minimum of three to four dishes per person in order to have a complete meal.

We went nearby for crepes and icecream afterwards, or I would definitely have stopped for a second dinner so I wouldn't go to bed hungry.",0,0

 I have been coming here since the grand opening. often about 20 or more times a year. its very consistent..the sushi is what i tackle first.. one time i ate 28 peices of sushi in one sitting...lol i wasnt feeling too great afterwards. BUT IT WAS GOOOOD. lol.

 i wouldnt get to hung on the endless crab legs though if theres a dinner rush. the crab leg section is always empty due to all the...""people"" that go there. 

The salad section doesnt look like it gets too picked out with all the raw stuff over there. people tend to stay away from that area.

  the main dishes section always has an array of different types of chicken, noodles, beef, and fish that make your mouth water.

dont really go to the hibachi cause i hate waiting but i have seen people getting food there and it looks like they know what there doing. also next to the hibachi they have a peeking duck that is to die for. very sweet and tender.

the appetizer section with the egg rolls and chicken on a stick is pretty dope. my favorite is the sesame balls. very doughy and good.

the fruit and desert bar had a recent additon....a chocolate fondue fountain! i feel bad for those people that gotta scrape the chocolate that almost becomes like cement when it goes on the plate.

1,"I ordered a pick-up from this location: one party size platter of Maki, Sushi and Sashimi and a medium size of just Maki and Sushi platter.

The ordering process was a tad difficult since there was a slight language barrier where the phone was passed back and forth a few times, which I was very understanding. Some people may find it annoying. But amazing service and very apologetic for the kinks.

After I had placed the order for pick-up, they had called me back right away explaining how the pick-up time would be super busy for them, if they could get the CC number in advanced, so when I come to pick it up, they just hand the platters over to me.

When I got there, there was a slight parking situation, very limited spots. The city of Toronto for you... also not so great parkers.

The shop is very small and easy to miss. The inside makes up for the outside. Wooden interior in a very small space. The staff greeted me right away and many assisted me at the same time. In the end, one server ended up handling my order and I just had to sign the merchant's receipt and off I go.

And now to the food, it was very fresh and delicious. Everyone at the office LOVED it and asked where they could get the sushi for the near future. The presentation of the platters were very pleasing. I didn't even want to eat it because it was that pretty. The manager did say she'll make it look wonderful and amazing to eat over the phone when I spoke to her. Very nice woman.",0,0

2,"I have never had to leave such a scathing review for any establishment in my life and I'm sorry. I tried to seek assistance while we were guests, and these efforts were an utter failure. Perhaps after reading my review, the hotel will take steps to ensure customer satisfaction is their number one priority. My fiancé and I traveled to Montreal to get married. Prior to arriving, on April 28, we confirmed via email with Erika (Reservations Manager) that we would have the Romance Package and a Regency Club room. Also prior to arriving, we pre-paid for the entire stay (June 2- June 10) - I'll come back to this point. We requested a quiet room ahead of time. We checked into the Hyatt Regency Montreal (room 516) on June 2. We phoned the front desk when we arrived to ask ""why was the room so small"", and were told ""all of our rooms are the same size"". Also, we noted the room appeared to be quite used. We paid approximately $2300 CAD for this stay; our expectations for an impressive room were not met- especially with the extra packages we added. We married on Wednesday, June 3. That morning we both had a massage that was advertised at $90 each (should have been a total of $180, I'll come back to this point.). The night of Thursday, June 4, I was kept awake until 4:30am by unruly hotel guests near us: running, screaming, stomping, and slamming doors down our hallway. I got up and left my room 3 times, even once meeting a member of the hotel staff (at around 3:30am). I asked him, ""please make this noise stop, I cannot take it anymore, I have not slept at all!"". He apologized and said he had been called up, other guests were upset as well, and the hotel was taking care of the problem. At 4:30am, I called the front desk the 3rd time, and told them that the situation was completely unacceptable and outrageous! The intolerable party noise going on in our hallway was unbearable. Around 5am I finally fell asleep. Friday, June 5 I spoke with Peter, the Manager. He apologized and moved us to room 808. By the way, room 808 was in overall better condition that room 516. During the room transition, we met 2 other people in the elevator who had just been sent to rooms already occupied by other guests. What a disaster! Furthermore, it was at that time brought to our attention that we had never been provided a Regency Club hotel key, and that they didn't even have that noted for our hotel stay! We'd been there for 3 days and confirmed this package weeks in advance! The hotel finally added it to our account and provided us with the proper hotel key- and they kindly did not charge us for it. In room 808, we also had neighbors playing absurdly loud music, shouting profanities that we could not help but to suffer through the walls. At least they only did this during the day, as they were out of the hotel during the early evening hours. Our remote control needed new batteries. We called the front desk around 10:00pm (2nd time calling for batteries) and were told, ""we don't have batteries at the front desk, but will sent maintenance by your room"". We fell asleep after midnight that night; we never received batteries. Therefore, could not operate the television AT ALL throughout our stay. Then, the next day our room key would not work at all, we were shut out of the room, and AGAIN had to go down to the front desk to obtain a new key (3rd time). By this point, we were completely annoyed and did not want to have to interact with this hotel anymore. What was the point? Our issues could have been easily resolved, and we could have truly enjoyed our honeymoon at this establishment, but the hotel seemed to be very unorganized and just could not coordinate their business properly. Upon checkout on June 10, we received the worst surprise of all! First of all, what should have been a charge for $180 for two massages magically turned into $230 ($50 price hike!). At that time, I told Ahmed, the Front Desk receptionist, that the hotel must revise their Spa Cards which advertise prices, as we were victims of false advertisement. Ahmed had a very indifferent attitude. Secondly, there was a balance of over $500 on our bill! Let me remind you we PREPAID about $2300 for our entire stay (the only charge should have been for the massages, which we were already ripped off for, and taxes!). When we inquired about this, Ahmed had no desire to take the time to explain this anomaly to us. During this time, the nicest, most friendly staff member we encountered was the bellman who was delivering our luggage downstairs. We walked over to another receptionist, Micael, to ask for a detailed explanation our whopping bill. Micael was wonderful and truly interested in helping us; he discovered that we'd been charged IN ERROR and reversed the charges, refunding our account. If it had been up to Ahmed, we'd just been ripped off another nearly $500. Thankfully, Micael is dedicated to customer service. All in all, save yourself the headache and stay away from this hotel.",0,0

I also tried their Pastel de Guava which wasn't horrible. I doubt I'll return until they add coffee to their menu. You can't name your bakery ""Suárez"" and not have spanish coffee. The service was friendly I must admit and if you check in on Yelp you get a free pastry.",2,2

1,"I've been to this location for the past 10 years because it was the first place I ever fell in love with jerk pork, however the last few years the quality has really gone down the drain. I kept coming back to give it ""one more chance"" for nostalgia sake but it just kept getting worse. 

The jerk pork dinner was my go to but nowadays it's just a jerk fat dinner instead. It tastes like I'm just eating lard and no pork because the meat cuts I get is so fatty. If I wanted more coleslaw instead of rice, the owner (Asian man) would not give it to me. He also always gave noticeably smaller portions then the girl who works there and I didn't like that.

The curry roti still tastes ok but the last couple times I ate it I got a stomach ache... not sure what that means :/... 

Side note: The girl who works there is very friendly and I liked going when she was working because she was always so kind and gave generous portions.

We contacted them a week in advanced to confirm if they would be able to accommodate the number of people we had and the time we wanted to come in. Not only was our reservation confirmed, but we also received a confirmation phone call an hour before from their manager. 

We got there about 10-15 before our time, but ended up waiting for more than 30 minutes after our confirmed appointment time. When they started to take us in, we were told they would only be able to accommodate half of us and the rest of us had to wait another ""few more minutes"". I was in the lucky half that had to wait an additional 25 minutes after the other half of the group went in. We politely asked the lady working in the front desk how much longer it would take because it's already been almost an hour of waiting at this point. She said that they were searching for more workers to come in. That's when I got super upset and asked her why they confirmed our appointment when they knew they didn't have enough workers to begin with. She had excuse after excuse until we got fed up and just walked out.

Pros- the service is good, my water was never empty, and plates were cleared quickly.  Cons- the food.  Bread was completely average- nothing special.  My house salad although flavorful was completely drowned in dressing. And onto my meal- spinach ravioli. I think the ravioli would have been great, but I could not taste it due to the obscene amount of garlic cream sauce it was drowned in. After that amount of garlic, I will never have to worry about vampires or my husband ever kissing me again. I have been here one time before and had a pasta dish with pancetta, peas and cream sauce. The sauce was so rich that it made me feel sick and lacked any real flavor.",0,0
2,"I got a Groupon for a 1 hour massage at n8 for Christmas so I scheduled a massage.
Mikylah did a very good job, and plaid close attention to the massage details.  I would say that she is very good at her job.  

However, there are a couple of details in terms of the facility that were not perfect: 
1-it was uncomfortably cold in the treatment room, 
2-the muzak was too loud at first, then cut off completely 2/3 of the way through the massage, 
3-the receptionist was short, both during check-in and check-out.  

More Importantly:

4-I received a gift of a 1 hour massage, however in n8 terms, that is really 35-40 minutes of massage.  I had read some of the reviews below, so I arrived early, checked-in, and was ready 5 minutes before the hour.  I was taken back to the room at 8 minutes after the hour, then the massage was over at 10 minutes before the hour.  Once you build in changing times, t's NOT even close to a 1-hour massage.
5-The receptionist put the hard sell on me to reschedule my next visit at the Groupon price, and she said that the offer was only good if I scheduled the second massage immediately.  Since it was a gift I didn't know what the Groupon price was, but there are HUGE signs in the facility advertising 1-hour massages for $38.  So I scheduled the apt and was about to ask her how much the Groupon price was, but she picked up the phone and started helping someone else, even though I was still standing there about to ask a couple of questions, not finished checking out.  Later, I asked the person who gifted the massage to me how much they paid.  Guess how much the Groupon price was on Dec 23rd?  $38 according to his bank statement. Buyer Beware.

Massages are usually nice.  That's what the experience is about.  But, if you can't count on a business, any business, to be upfront, give you what they advertise (""1-hour massage"" seems pretty clear to me), give you all of the information that you need to make a wise purchase (reschedule) choice, and pay attention to the comfort details, I'd say it's better to spend your massage dollars elsewhere.  Customers shouldn't feel the need to protect themselves from the massage business.",0,0

My husband and i went home for the holidays so we rented a car from sixt because it was the cheapest (now i know why). Our flight didnt get in till 1am by the time we get our rental car it wasnt until 3am. The customer service was awful and when i say awful i mean the girl at the counter was just so snotty and you can tell she just did not want to be there. We were already so tired and just wanted to be on our way so to be greeted the way we were just was not right. We were told that they had to hold a $200 deposit and as soon as we dropped the car back off we would get it back. No big deal! Nope we were lied to and never got the $200 back so instead of a $160 rental it ended up being $360. We also did not get the insurance on the car because we did not need to spend the extra money because our personal auto insurance covers this. Long story short we had our rental car for about 6 days. When we dropped it off the girl checked the car for damages LIKE EVERY RENTAL CAR DOES! She told us the car was in great condition and took the keys from us and told us we were good to go. fast forward to a month later we get a letter in the mail stating that we damaged their rental vehicle!! This company is full of liars. CHEAP COMPANY. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Go to a more common rental company just anything but this one.

I quickly called to let them know so we could get it fixed. Well that call turned out to be a call with the girl who took my order going over it again and me letting her know what was missing. Some guy, the one who filled my order,  got on the phone and was rude. He blamed the girl up front for not giving me the BBQ sauce, ok... Then he started going on about what he saw and what he cooked.
So, you mean to tell me that my receipt and what you get in the kitchen are 2 different tickets? I know better than that! He didn't ask us to bring our order back so we could show what was wrong. I live right up the street! Nope, he just wanted to argue his point. I got no apology or anything to try to fix the issue at all. Once I realized all he wanted to do was argue that he did nothing wrong, I hung up. 
The fries we ordered were stale and not good. The wings were cool. AZ Spicy are not the same as the old ATL seasoning. It is more spice than flavor now. But I fully blame myself for assuming it would be the same. I also admit I have not been here since it was ATL Wings. But I will say the wings were cooked well, this is why they got 2 stars. 
But you never argue with someone who has a receipt with their exact order and the food in front of them DOES NOT match the order on their receipt!
I will never buy a single item from this place again.",1,0

1,"Brought my uncle here for dinner because I wanted him to try the wonderful Lasagna they have.  What a mistake that ended up being.  There was maybe 1/4 of the amount of ricotta cheese that is normally there (and that is shown in all the pictures) so the whole thing tasted like mush.  No texture....my uncle even said ""this tastes like they put it in a blender it's so soft).  

We also ordered the brussel sprouts but i think they forgot them in the oven for about 15 minutes too long. Totally dry and way overcooked.

We asked the waiter to give us some balsamic vinegar because they were really overcooked and he didn't even offer to get us new ones or to even ask about them.

Needless to say, I won't go to this Buca again and it will be a long time till I try any of them again.",0,0

3,"Came for dinner on a weeknight. The girls up front were friendly and welcoming. The wait for 2 people to get seated was about 15 minutes and we received a text message when our table was ready. 

We were seated at one of the high top communal tables. If we were there with a group it would have been fine, but as a couple seated next to another couple it felt awkward and tight. The music was pretty loud as well. 

Our server was ok to begin with, but as our meal went on it got harder to get a hold of him. When we did get a hold of him, he seemed a bit befuddled. It also took a while to get orders delivered to the table. I've never been to a Korean BBQ joint where we had nothing on the grill for longer than 5 min. tops. Here we waited about 15-20 min. 

The plain brisket, pork, and roast beef were good, however I would advise against the marinated meats. The macaron ice cream was tasty and the perfect size. The price for dinner was comparable to other places around town, but there's really nothing that made us want to come back.",1,0

I had to dig through a pound of noodles just to find any chicken under there. No veggies really, just a few stocks of green onion. Not sure what all the great reviews were about.

0,"Moxie, the Restaurant is a blatantly self-conscious eatery that serves mostly meat and seafood. Everyone in our party of five for a business dinner enjoyed our food. 

Portions were healthy without being too large. My Osso buco was a tad dry but worked well with the roasted root vegetables and goat cheese polenta. The demi sauce pulled the dish together. It was a very hearty meal on a cold night but was heavy with both polenta and fingerling potatoes. The large bowl they served it in made it a little hard to get to. 

Some others in our party ordered the firecracker shrimp that were large. They all cleaned their plates. The salmon portion looked on the small side.

Our table of six were able to converse at a pleasant level without straining to hear. But the restaurant was not too busy.

2,"Went here for Dining Out for Life a couple of days ago. I heard that the Pork Osso Bucco is awesome, but it's a large entree and ALOT of food, so I decided to order the Beef Tenderloin Filet instead. The chorizo, potato and menonita cheese stuffed poblano was tasty, the filet was overdone, so was a bit on the dry side.  Don't get me wrong, it was still edible, however, there was not nearly enough sauce to battle the dryness *sigh*. 

Hubby and one of our friends ordered the Sergio's Pork Tenderloin, said both of their entrees were overdone and (again) not enough sauce. 

The pomegranate margarita was good, but nothing extra special. 

Our waitress was pleasant, but didn't know anything about the items on the menu, read through the list of specials like she was actually an auctioneer and forgot how to breath, couldn't make any recommendations, and well, seemed to be more of a hostess than a member of the wait staff.

8,"Food - 10 stars. Service - NEGATIVE ONE MILLION stars.

The short version is, I probably won't return to this Burgatory location again. I'll stick to the Waterworks, where they have customer service in spades.  

I don't care for bullet points in lieu of narrative, but the longer version goes a little something like this:

* Our party of 9 visited Burgatory this past Saturday for what was to be a celebratory pre-show birthday dinner before a 7pm show at The Improv.

* The birthday girl and beau arrived at 4:30pm (per Burgatory's recommendation) to put our name on the list. 

* We were seated at approximately 6pm - not totally out of the realm of understanding, given that we were at a restaurant on a Saturday night that doesn't accept reservations.

* Our server wasn't rude, but I wouldn't call her ""nice"" either.  We gently mentioned to her that we were attempting to make a 7pm show and she said that wouldn't be a problem.

* It was a problem.

* We were approached once about drinks and had to seek her out to request a second round.  We would've had more given the opportunity.

* Seven of the nine of us received our food at 6:50pm.  The remaining two were told that their food was on its way.  It wasn't...anytime soon.

* It wasn't until a manager approached the table to apologize for the ""mistake"" that we even realized a mistake had been made. The server made no reference to this whatsoever.  The manager offered a complimentary side dish to each of the affected, which was appreciated.

* When our food finally arrived, it was INCREDIBLE. Many, many kudos to the culinary team for a series of meaty flavor explosions heard 'round the table and possibly, around the entire Waterfront.

* To recap - The server was nearly non-existent. Though she verbally recognized our request to complete dinner by 7pm she ignored it when it mattered, and never once apologized for the food issues or lack of attention to our timeframe.  I don't like her.

* The manager comped the burgers of the two who didn't receive their food with the rest of us. That's appreciated, but a bit too little, a bit too late.

* I'm sad.",2,0

Inside the place is very old looking and not decorated too much. One thing I did see is a signed picture of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Very cool. 

The owner took our order and was very nice. He helped us order and we got his lunch special instead of paying even more. I'm always a sucker for meatball sandwiches so I had to try this and plus this is a pizza dive so I had to try the typical thin crust pepperoni. I really enjoyed the meatball sandwich. Nice and hot and juicy. They put about 5 or 6 meatballs in the sandwich which gives your a nice bite every time. The tomato sauce was pretty good too. So the meatball sandwich passed my test. Yum yum. I also enjoyed the pizza. Crust was very good. So I enjoyed it. 

So they have thin and thick pizza crust. There were people coming in and out of this little place while we were there the whole time. Pretty impressive for a little pizza place. Only thing i didnt like was their air conditioning. It wasn't working very well and you had to go in the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Dirty bathroom but remember this is a dive. So not bad place.

Feel like family from the time you walk in, until the time you leave and they really care about your pet.  My dog had to have his teeth cleaned and the results were amazing!! I admit I was leary about the price...way more than mine to clean...lol...but I dont have to have anesthesia either.  I wish I could show you the before and after...100percent difference! 
   He is a pug/terrier mix and has the ""little useless teeth"" in the front between his fangs which at his ripe old age of 10 needed to come out. He also had a couple molars that were getting in trouble and they called me in the middle of the procedure to explain and get my ideas if I wanted them taken care of then, which in the long run will save me another treatment! 
   I actually cried when they took him to the back for surgery as well as when I came to pick him up...BEFORE I saw him! We reviewed all the paperwork, with me sniveling the entire time feeling guilty I did this to him, THEN they brought him out to me!  He looked GREAT and put my heart at ease! (He did punish me tho by not licking my face when I tried to kiss him) :(   
   Today, just ONE DAY after his cleaning and teeth pulling he was eating great and even brought the ball to me to play! AMAZING! 
    Have to admit....wasn't sure the price was worth it but his teeth and gums look beautiful now, the infection that was developing around those teeth is gone and his crooked looking teeth in the bottom front are gone and he is even more handsome!

8,"6 MONTHS AGO I brought my chow girl in for a lion cut here and the groomer did a beautiful job on her and had her done in 4 hours.

THIS MORNING at 8am I took my same chow girl in and requested a ""lion cut"" which she has had at least 6 times before not only from here but also other groomers. Today she came out looking like a giant chihuahua with cut marks all over her body especially all around her neck from being shaved too close. When I picked her up I was very disappointed in what they did however I did not notice all the cut marks until we got home, they had tied a rag (torn piece of material) that was supposed to be a bow around her neck...probably because they were trying to hide the cuts around her neck.

This place is horrible and the groomers are unprofessional. Previously they accepted credit cards and checks now they only accept cash. They had my dog from 8am in the morning til 4pm at night. By far the worst haircut ever.

I called to tell them about the how dissatisfied I was and I was told she was too matted and it was more humane for them to shave her close...how is it humane to cut up the animal all over her body with a shaver? I stated that they did not even leave any fur but a few strands on her tail...you cannot tell me that was too matted as well, her response ""we will put this on your card for next time around to leave more fur."" Manager could have cared less, she continued to say the same lines over and over as if she has said them before.

It's a shady place, do not trust them with your animal, I am sorry I did.",0,0
5,"A couple of things - firstly, it's crummy that The Beer Store is pretty much a beer monopoly here in Ontario. The notion that Labatt and Molson should get to choose which beers we buy is a drag, but whatever. I have to admit that even if I had all the choices in the world, I'd likely stick with many of the big name brands that The Beer Store sells. Regardless, it's kind of crazy that the government sold this license to just the big guys, boxing out so many of the microbreweries that have popped up in ON.

Secondly, why can people return ALL THE TIME!?! Here's what you do - returns are from 11 AM till 4 PM Monday to Friday and Sunday. Why do we need these rules? Because I'm sick and tired of waiting behind the old dude bringing back a thousand stinking cans when I drop by after work for a six pack. Why couldn't he have gotten all that together earlier in the day!? It's not a huge deal, but then again, it wouldn't be a huge deal to implement 'return hours' so that at crazy busy times (most days after 5 and especially Friday and Saturday afternoons and night) all staff would be focused on getting beer purchasers out the door.

Apart from those things, The Beer Store is the private monopoly that allows me to buy beer without walking all the way to Spadina. For that I salute it (until the new LCBO opens up at College and Manning, then it's so long, suckers!).",3,4

Pad Thai was good. It wasn't too mushy and noodles were soft. There's a nice balance between noodles and extra toppings like the meat and veggies and sprouts. I think the sauce needs a bit work though. The flavours were there, but not strong like Pad Thai should be. I didn't get a clear tangy vs sweet vs salty effect that you expect from Pad Thai. Ended up putting curry sauce to mix in. Curry, by the way, was pretty good. Decent comfort food style.

I'm a bit weary about places that offer Japanese and Thai food.. It's not quite fusion as it's just offering dishes from both cuisines for the most part.

This purchase was made at the beginning of March. I took the rug back to the store ( on MLK) and reordered the correct one. I was told that it would be here in April..I received a phone call yesterday stating to come pick the rug up only to find out its not at the store , it has been discontinued!!! 

I also made a separate purchase of a mattress, barstools & TV stand in February. I get the phone call that my mattress and barstools will be delivered ! Perfect ! Barstools come in  mattress comes in . Not the correct mattress. I get a phone call from the ppl in AZ whom by the way are very unprofessional and rude, saying they have no idea when the correct mattress will be delivered. bout 4 days later I get the correct mattress! Now I'm happy! 

As far as the TV stand goes I knew that wouldn't be delivered until April 4th when I made the purchase ( so I thought). I get a phone call from the ppl in AZ saying the TV stand has been pushed back for delivery until April 7th. Ok that's fine...

Service was quick and very friendly.  We ordered spring rolls to share as an appetizer for $7.00 and they were delicious.   Lovely tangy sauce for dipping and the spring rolls were nice and crispy without being too oily.
All of our mains were delicious as well. The Pad Thai was authentic and perfect heat with the ""foreigner"" spice. 
Another main ordered was the Khao Pad Thamada with chicken.  Lovely Jasmine rice with hints of oyster sauce and lime.
I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with pork.  I felt adventurous so ordered Thai spicy which notes on the menu as being the most authdntic Thai heat. I do like my food spicy so was up for the taste test.   The waitress did ask me if I was sure of the heat choice and I had to assure her it would be fine.  The pork was served over jasmine e rice and was very flavorful.  And yes the Thai heat was very spicy but very tasty if you like things hot.
The most interesting presentation was the Gaeno Kiaw Wan.  Green curry with beef.  This main arrives in a coconut with a side of jasmine rice.  The coconut adds a bit of sweetness to the curry and although the ""foreigner"" spice was ordered the coconut milk also alleviated some of the heat.

I ordered the Belgian Waffle w/ fresh Strawberries and coffee. I was unimpressed with the ""Belgian"" part of the waffle. It wasn't as thick with deep pockets as I was expecting. More importantly it was cold such that the individual butter pats didn't even melt. I should have asked to have the waffle made over or at least reheated or toasted but I didn't. The syrup was a sticky plastic bottle of Log Cabin, needless to say it was unheated. However the best part of the breakfast were the fresh Strawberries (they too were cold but oh yeah they're suppose to be), red and sweet but no whipped cream. The coffee was luke warm and very weak we had to ask for a hot fresh cup hoping it would be stronger. The others in my group had traditional egg breakfasts and omelets, with meat, potatos and toast which were just OK. This place is barely average at best and definitely skip the waffle.
I was surprised Nick's was so full of people but then again, I was in Surprise AZ. pun intended.",0,0
4,"The view is amazing .... from the minute you enter the glass elevator all the way up to the top floor of Mandalay's ""HOTEL"" tower and to the balcony, the view of the Strip is breathtaking.  This place is supercool and great to hang out in and enjoy a beverage. 

Now, for the restaurant, and most importantly, the food.  The food selection on the menu is decent, with most of the standard fair you'd expecet (a handful each of appetizers, fish & seafood, meats &  poultry).  Expect to pay a hefty price for your view, with prices ranging from 45 to 60+ dollars for entrees (and thats for non ""market price"" items), which is a little silly, even for French (or French/American) cuisine in Vegas.  Tack on appetizers, a beverage, and dessert (at your discretion) and expect $150 a head.

The food preparation was respectable, but, by no means were my companions and I impressed.   The foie was decent, as was the bisque.  The huckleberry sauce for the fois was well balanced with just enough tartness and sweetness, but, one of my liver pieces was a bit veiny.  Kudos for having caviar on the menu.  The fish was nicely prepared (not overdone) but relatively straight forward (no pow).  The scallop caesar was good, but the romaine wedge seemed tough, and the addition of basalmic over the dish made everything a little too tangy.  Bacon makes anything taste better, and this was no exception as there were plenty of rendered bacon bits.  Oddly enough, none of us had any meat dishes, which I would've like to have been able to comment on.  The desserts looked fabulous, but only tasted okay good and didn't quite close the deal for me.  But, overall a decent meal.  Unfortunately, I was left with the feeling that the food experience paled in comparison to the personal experience as the presentation and service outshined the flavors.

The most memorable things were 1) the cool environment, 2) the sheer number of handblown glass bulbs hanging from the central chandelier and of course 3) the view.  

Really, this place is all about ambiance.  And thats ok, as long as it doesn't try to pretend to be something else.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat, if only to enjoy the view from the top.  But next time, i may decide to grab a bite elsewhere before heading up there to relax.  Maybe at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar downstairs?",3,1

5,"YELP REVIEW UPDATE

I AM UBER BUMMED, but my review below was for the CHEYENNE location, not this Rainbow location. Apparently the CHEYENNE location went out of business. The last time I was there, the managers told me they were opening a second location (Rainbow).

It's all good though, because you can get the original Bobbie from Capriottis just down the street on Cheyenne and Buffalo. It's no knockoff like the Robert.

Also, beware of false advertising. These guys claim LV Weekly gave them the award for ""Best Sandwich in Las Vegas"" in 2010 and 2011. Not entirely true. In 2010, they were tied with Capriotti's. And in 2011, the best sandwich went to The Johnny at Johnny McGuire's. Google it for yourself. 

Don't buy into false advertising. This place off Cheyenne was damn good. But don't let lies deceive you.

In any case, any Yelp reviews you see, might be from the old location at Cheyenne. Not a knock on Eddie D's because I used to love this place. I just don't want my review of the Cheyenne location to transfer over to the Rainbow location. It's not fair.",3,1

Came with lots of lettuce and some fresh tomatoes, and good sauce. Mine had cod in it, and the cod smelled too fishy. I think it was dried or preserved or something, which must be why it was chewier and smellier than the usual cod that comes in a sandwich.

Not my cup of tea, personally. I expected more based on such a high yelp rating.

Also, their back patio smells a big like stale garbage...I'm guessing there is some garbage behind the wooden walls of the patio.",1,0

The service was prompt and quick, which is nice BUT our waiter checked on us every 3 minutes--I'm not even joking. We wanted to sit and have a conversation which was hard because he was interrupting us every second--he was very nice and attentive and I could tell he meant well and wanted to give us a great experience.

The service here is superb! The waitress made excellent recommendations based off what I enjoyed in the past. It got a little busy around the time we ordered, but she still managed to check up on us.

My biggest bone to pick with this place is that their injera comes out cold. My friend made the same complaint when I told her I gave this place a try. The food itself was warm and filling. However, it was an unpleasant surprise that the vegetarian dishes were more flavourful than the meat. I've had Ethiopian food before and though this is good, it doesn't constitute as great.",0,0

They have a great recreational and team program. I tried having my kids try gymnastics locally at several gyms and I wasn't impressed.  I noticed they would go up to 16 kids in a class or had instructors that didn't look like they had much training at all. The class sizes are much smaller at  Madison Turners .

We decided to come here on a Friday around 8 and it wasn't too crowded. We greeted warmly by the hostess and seated quickly. Our waiter was friendly and took our drink orders promptly and gave us some time to look through our menus. My fella and I decided to share the baked brie to start. I ordered the salmon caesar salad, while my fella ordered the bbq chicken pizza. The baked brie came out and was very tasty. I'm always a fan of baked brie and this was one was definitely solid. The salad portion was enormous, the piece of salmon was huge. I had to take most of this dish home. My fella enjoyed his pizza quite a bit and took most of his home for leftovers as well. Best of all, our meals tasted great the next day too.

The service was good and prices were good as well. The atmosphere is nice as well.

I'm a chilaquiles connoisseur. Hash Kitchen's are mediocre. The green sauce is too sour. 

My daughter's scrambled eggs were served runny and raw. We complained and were brought burnt, brown eggs instead. 

My son ordered the kids' pancakes but we all agreed they tasted lemony, so I think he was served the wrong kind. 

Last time I came, my husband and I were disappointed by the eggs Benedict (bland) and the carnitas hash, which was too oily. Eggs over medium are served over easy.

4,"I wish there was an option for zero stars, the staff was very nice but it just so happens  one of them don't really know how to bleach hair, there are tons of checkered marks on my head now, and I now have it bleached 5 times lighter then I wanted because the other salon I just went to needed to remove as much of the orange as they could and some of the missed dark brown spots in between that needed to be bleached. Just trying to make it slightly okay took over 4 and a half hours and the orange still isn't gone. 

She charged 150 and apparently even if it costs you to get it fixed it doesn't matter. She also refuses to give refunds. Well now my hair is  completely fried and pretty unhealthy and it makes me really upset that it has to be bleached again after the appointment I just had with someone else, I have tons of dark lines on my head now because the foils weren't on right and my roots underneath my hair and at the top are brown because she didn't bleach to my scalp.

I appreciate the politeness of her and her effort, and I didn't want to have to leave this review since she was sweet, at least until we wanted a refund. But since she refuses to give any of the money back at all, I have to save somebody else from going through the same situation. It's hard for me to write this only because she was very nice, but niceness sadly doesn't make up for the health of my hair.

3,"Dr. Robert Cohen and his staff at the Scottsdale Center for Plastic Surgery are beyond compare.  

The decision to undergo an elective surgery for me was one of the most difficult decisions.  To be completely honest, I never thought that I would have ever even considered it.  However, after having breastfed my two children each for a little over year, my breasts were completely deflated and my sense of femininity was obsolete. 

When choosing a surgeon, it is extremely important to pick a surgeon that is board-certified, well rounded; you feel comfortable, confident in his/her abilities and can fully trust.  I immediately felt that with Dr Cohen.  Dr. Cohen is a brilliant surgeon and his bedside manner is impeccable!  He is board-certified, has undergone rigorous training with the best plastic surgeons in the world, and uses the most advance techniques.  He uses board-certified anesthesiologists, highly skilled nurses, and a state of the art facility for all of his procedures.  In addition, his attention to detail, genuine compassion, perfectionist nature, and his natural ability to communicate and listen are admirable!  Given all of his many qualities and my past experience with Dr. Cohen, I knew that he was the plastic surgeon for me.

I was fortunate enough to meet Dr. Cohen for the first time in 2006.  My boyfriend at the time was in a tragic accident, and we were blessed to have had Dr. Cohen on call that night.  I can remember it like it was yesterday.  My boyfriend's brother, cousin and I were first at the hospital, and Dr. Cohen and the attending ER/Trauma doctor came in to the waiting room to discuss what was going on with him.  The trauma doctor began to go down a laundry list of injuries that he sustained, including a complete scalp avulsion, bilateral (double) pneumothorax (collapsed lung), broken neck, multiple broken ribs, and the list goes on and on.  The second that the trauma doctor stated that my boyfriend was probably not going to make it, I completely tuned out.  As he was finishing up discussing the situation, my boyfriends parents arrived to the hospital and the trauma doctor said that he was not going to repeat himself, and that we could just explain the situation ourselves to his parents, as he needed to get back to work.  While I understood, I was completely speechless.  Dr. Cohen immediately stepped up, took us all into a private room and began to reiterate what the trauma doctor discussed.  It was at that moment that I knew how special Dr. Cohen was.  Later on that night Dr. Cohen spent hours reconstructing his head.   His work was unreal!  Looking at the before and after pictures, it is amazing how talented Dr. Cohen truly is!  

When I decided to undergo my breast augmentation, I knew that I would only follow through with the procedure if Dr. Cohen was performing it.  On the day of surgery, I had no hesitation, as I knew that I was in the absolutely best hands.  My surgery was flawless!  I had minimal bruising, swelling, and pain, and the results are perfect.  

He and his staff are beyond compare!  From the moment you walk into his office, you feel at ease.  The entire surgical processes from consultation to recovery, Dr. Cohen and his staff (Bri, Cassie, and Mary) make every effort to make you feel like you are their one and only patient.  They are responsive to your every need, attentive and truly care.  I can honestly say that they not only have the highest standards of patient care, but are truly genuine and kindhearted people.

It is without hesitation that I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Cohen.  He is simply the best plastic surgeon!",0,1
1,"Some good, some bad.  But the ""bad"" is personal preference on my part.

This store is a clearance store.  They get floor models and discontinued merchandise from a few places including Costco.  The ""bad"" there is that it's potentially led a rough life thus far, so you really need to inspect carefully.  We saw a Costco ""cooler"" bag with a handle that was almost completely ripped.  The good is that you can get Costco merchandise at about 40% off.

Their stock will change every few weeks, not unlike Costco.  Unlike Costco you do not get the Costco guarantee policy (which is one of the main features of Costco!).  But for 40% off maybe it's OK.  Be choosy, inspect carefully.

I'm glad I didn't have anything in my stomach when we got there because the smell alone would have made me hurl.. This was not sewage but old burnt dirty grease like the place hadn't been cleaned in years and it took about 45 minutes to get our food which looked amazing but tasted like the place smelled.. The sandwiches were huge but I couldn't make up my mind so I got the Split Decision which had both corned beef and pastrami on it with mustard and pickles.. It tasted like a ham sandwich only soaked in grease.. Now the fries were amazing they were the garlic Romano fries.. I can't tell you how much the only reason this got a three star rating was for the milkshake.. This milkshake was awesome. I got the mocha caramel shake and it was heaven in every sip..

1,"This place is OK but not mind blowing.  The menu is large and the price is very affordable, but the food felt average to me.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing considering the pancakes and waffles looked amazing, but I walked out not feeling like I had to go back anytime soon.

if I have one recommendation, it's to try one of the fancier, over the top, items on the menu... they looked very good from afar and based on the other reviews I think they might be the key to making this place a 4 or 5 star.",0,1
1,"Located on the third floor of Nordstrom at Yorkdale, Bazille is a restaurant that serves up bistro cuisine in a contemporary environment. My party and I dropped by on a Saturday around 12pm for lunch. During our meal, the restaurant filled up quickly with diners taking a break from their shopping.

To start, my party of 4 shared the calamari. The calamari batter was crispy and light and paired well with the lemongrass sweet chili dipping sauce. For the mains, I ordered one of the specials of the day (the Thai steak salad) as well as a cup of crab bisque as I was feeling hungry. The rest of my party ordered the smoked meat sandwich (which was another daily special), the nicoise salad with wild salmon, and the sauteed chicken and angel hair pasta. My salad and soup were great. The soup was rich and creamy but not terribly heavy.In addition to the crab, there were also vegetables in the soup. My Thai steak salad was also great with vermicelli noodles and romaine lettuce. The rest of my party also enjoyed their food.

Overall, friendly service and good food.",0,1

It was plenty of food for me and my two boys (11 & 9). They both loved the place too. The coffee was good, though I did have to ask for a refill after waiting a while hoping someone would come by. Our waiter was very attentive, other than the coffee ;). All was reasonably priced, I'd say $7-16 per person depending on how big a meal your going for. The food was all very good, and came out quick and hot. My son had grits with his kids platter and they were hot and delicious, which most places don't get right. Looking forward to going back.

0,"I come here for only one reason. The chips and salsa. The food is very, very mediocre (similar to the taste of Macayo's) and the service is usually less than that. In fact, there have been times where the waitresses (especially one particular waitress, with short, curly hair, who has been there forever) are just down right rude. I have gone there with about 30 different people (my school district is in the same area so everybody in my district goes to Popo's, especially on days that we have half days or professional developments), and the several times that we've gone, it NEVER fails!!!....my colleagues complain that the service is bad and the waitress is rude. I even told the manager about one particular waitress and he didn't seem to care much.  If you walk in knowing that, you'll be okay. The salsa is beyond delicious though! I am pretty picky about my salsa since I grew up in an authentic Mexican food environment and I will tell you, you'll love their salsa.  So....5 stars for the salsa, 2 and a half stars for the rest of the menu and 1 star for the service. However, because I LOVE their salsa, I wilm always come back.",0,0

Totally defeats the purpose of delivery. This company should heed advice here  to notify customers right away for such shortages.  

I called Thai Express, and asked why I was not informed of the missing item a the time of ordering.  No reply to this question.  I asked for a refund for food not delivered.  He said call grub hub.

2,Brought my cat who had urinary problems. She was peeing blood and in obvious pain. We brought her in and after a check up she was simply sent home and we were asked to come back when we collected a sample of her urine. How are we supposed to collect urine from a cat who is hiding from us because she is in pain and who only pees in a litter box? They sold us a kit to collect urine but it didn't work. We finally decided to empty her litter box and force her to pee there.  It worked (after 3 days)and after the results came in( another 2 days) it turned out our cat had a bladder full of crystals. After a week of medication she was fine and is now on a special urinary food that we must purchase from the vet. It is very expensive but our cat is healthy now. Overall the staff was friendly and helpful. I will continue to take my cat to the humane society for shots and yearly visits because it's cheaper but if my cat is ever sick again I will definitely bring her here. I will also continue to purchase her special food from here as long as she is alive.,0,0

Our table was dirty, I had to ask 3 times to get a clean glass and then I ended up switching with someone who had a clean glass that wasn't drinking. 

Lastly a chicken finger dish is $18 with tax... Used to be $12. That is ridiculous, especially seeming its nothing close to high class and the plate only came 4 4 inch strips, which we're subpar.

4,"I am happy to report a redemption story, thanks to great customer service from this location's manager! 

Attempting to celebrate my aunt's birthday dinner, a ten person party of us came to Outback. There are many places in this town that we could go to celebrate a birthday, but my aunt is a franchise-fiend. In the past we have had positive experiences with Outback, so fine. 

Long story short, we experienced one of the most confusing, slow and disappointing dinner services I have ever had. We arrived later in the evening since we had to accommodate everyone's schedule. Our family is rarely all together and we were easily the largest party in the restaurant, on a very quiet Saturday night. 

As my husband and I were preparing to leave, I felt terrible for my aunt as I watched her look at her bill bewilderingly and shell out a large amount of money for an awful dinner and dinner experience.  

I am not one to complain unless my service is WAY off of the mark and this event called for it. I spoke to the manager today and explained the situation. I let him know that we are willing to return, but we want a different experience than what we had. 

When I arrived to meet with the manager this evening, I was concerned because the hostess returned to tell me that it would be 15-20 min. before he could meet with me, as they were ""really busy."" Yeah, so am I. And we've already paid. 

Instead, the manager was out to meet with me within 5 minutes. He quickly rectified the situation and we were able to receive gift certificates to have a redeux of my aunt's gathering. 

Five stars for the manager's response to our circumstances.",2,3

We've watched Munchies and thought, we gotta try this place out one day.
Friends raved that this place is a must try, so we finally went.

Ordered one of their specials
-Rice Rice Baby! = Lobster Fried Rice MP $50 - tasty, but we tasted the fried shrimp more than the lobster.  Overpriced.  I wouldn't order again.
-Craving For Seafood? = House Special Oysters (12 pc) $21.99 - worth the price and very fresh and Ono!  I would order again.
-Appetizers = District One Beef Carpaccio $12.99 - not bad.  I might order again.
-Special for the day = snails (forgot price) - very gamy, gritty.  NOT A FAVORITE.  Not like escargot elsewhere.  Never order.
-Appetizers = Belly Bun $7.99.  Okay.  We weren't suppose to order something we can get elsewhere, but i like braised pork belly and we can make better at home.  I wouldn't order again.

Nice workers.  We had two servers.  Younger guy and a little bit order gentlemen.  Never got asked for refills on our drinks, like the people that came after us.  But overall, this place is okay.  Not such a hype.

But they are apparently famous for their Pho.  So next time, if we get a chance to want to go back again, we will try their Pho.",0,0
1,"Three and a half stars because I'm feeling generous today. 

Actually it would be a solid two, if it weren't for a couple of things:

Customer service is surprisingly good. Call them and before too long and without too much navigation you will get an actual human on the line, who will genuinely try to assist in your plight, whatever it may be. In many cases, they can't help you but are fairly good about putting you into touch with someone to come by your house. 

Unfortunately, that is where they lose it. The people that come by your house say they'll show up ""between 2 and 7"" (this is totally inexcusable to me, btw. It is the 21st century for christs' sake, you have an email address, a cell phone, and maybe even a blackberry. You can narrow it down to atleast a two hour block. This goes for the lot of them.)

The other redeemer is that sometimes the mistakes Cox makes can actually benefit you, the customer. Case in point, my sister purchased a basic cable package for a few months before deciding she didn't watch it so she called them and had it turned off. Unless someone was just being nice, they took the cable box but the basic cable continues to work to this day on her TV, almost a year later.

So don't ever say incompetence can't hook it up from time to time.",2,1

Multiple times I requested open houses and was told no, i was out of town 3 consecutive weekends and he only managed to show the house 3 times. The house went on the market late.

You guys are like every con artist I have ever met. You have an excuse for everything and false promises. Your so-called pre-qualification likely discouraged people from looking.

1,"Cleveland bagel is the perfect quick breakfast everyone needs! The line is usually pretty long, but it moves pretty fast. They have some indoor and outdoor seating, and parking out front and on the street. Now about the bagels... wow wow wow they are amazing!! They don't have a ton of flavors, but the flavors they do have are staples. I got the egg and cheese and I added avocado and onion on a plain bagel. The avocado was fresh and just the whole thing was delicious. I usually tend to go for a more sweet bagel, and at Cleveland Bagel they have a cinnamon cranberry. I love Cleveland Bagel, and I think many people can agree that they are the best bagels around .",1,2

Would be nice to enclose the patio, so to maximize seating on these chilly days. :)   The Kickback  Chicken and Baby Potato Salad were yummy. Only wished we had a smidge more goat cheese (abt 1/2 tsp) on the Kickback, however; the biscuit was deliciously golden and done.   Maybe they rushed out our order since it was take-out.  Beignets were also good and may try with jam next time, plus  the yummy cheddar grits. Our tummies were pleased.",0,0

We arrived at 8pm, and didn't get seated until after 9, when theoretically, we could have been seated within 20-30 minutes.

ALSO! - They have a coupon on their website for all these specials - they dont' even know what it is!  

Be careful when you call and book an appointment, they have so many different packages listed that the one I booked (from their website), was NOT on their printed spa menu and it was also not on wayspa.

The actualy service was mediocre.  Highlights included the ladies there trying really hard to do a good job (my pedicure was only mediocre, but she was very nice).  The facial was average with minimal extraction work.

I don't know if I would go back.  Despite them ripping off $10 from my package and NOT accepting their own website voucher (I did not argue with them as english communication was tough), the package was cheap.  Pedi / Head wash and facial for $85.

I would try a body massage next time - seems like something they would be okay at.  I do have to commend the ladies for trying to do a good job.",4,0

0,"I love Tropical Smoothie! I used to be a Jamba Juice lover but ended up preferring Trop over it. I commonly go through their drive through during happy hour (5-7pm) when we get the buy 2 get 1 free deal. However, there has been some instances where the cashier would charge us for the third drink and when we would mention the happy hour deal they would say it's invalid because we didn't tell them at the window... I think that rule is pretty ridiculous, you advertise it on your twitter and on your store window yet when people order 3 smoothies during 5pm to 7pm, you can't automatically assume that the happy hour deal is activated?! Anyways aside from their rule... I love the Bahama Mama with white chocolate or their Tropicolada! Two drinks are roughly $11 so it's not bad for the price.",0,0

1,"I want to start out by saying that the food here was delicious. We enjoyed all of it. The beverages however, were not. The mango smoothie lacked mango flavor and my matcha iced was $6.5 CAD and the worst I've ever tried. The service was poor. Our waitress was spread thin and unable to take our order for quite some time. The entire brunch process took much longer than it needed to, from ordering to delivery of food to payment to to-go boxes. 

The real kicker: FOR FOREIGNERS: I am from the US. The waitress knew we were from the US when she began serving us and did not mention that they only take debit and CAD. It was listed on the menu  that they do. And if they take USD you must pay the bill matched, so if it's $85 CAD, you are responsible for $85 USD. There was a bank and atm down the street they directed us to. We had to leave our ID, and walk to the bank to discover that it was Sunday and of course closed. Conveniently or should I say inconveniently the atm machine was broken. So we returned embarrassingly counting our US dollars to the penny. 

Sure the food was great but I've never been anywhere that doesn't take credit card for a $200 bill. This place is not cheap at all so I really wasn't expecting it. Sure of you have rock bottom prices and really can't afford to take the hit of a credit card fee, I can understand. But this place had no excuse. My bill for a dish, gratuity included, tax and a drink was $25.",0,0
8,"Welcome to the present, GTA (looks at TTC in particular).  The one card to rule them all so far has had many ups and downs it seems.  I just got mine this week because tokens will be gone come next year for the TTC.  I never use any other transit in the GTA except the TTC and that includes GO, MiWay etc.  I just don't, for now.

The only thing I can really compare Presto to is Ventra which is Chicago's version which came out after the Presto system (2013 as opposed to 2009).  The reality is Presto has been around longer for the other transit systems in neighboring municipalities but the big integration is really for the TTC because we all know the TTC is a dinosaur.  The costs to integrate this or a system like this are already making news saying that there have been delays and cost overruns.  Wow, what a surprise... everything the TTC touches in some way basically is assumed to cost more than what they thought it would and take longer.  That's like a given, right?

I ordered my card pre-loaded online with 29 dollars on it (10 x TTC adult fares).  The new card is 6 dollars when ordering so it came out to 35 bucks.  It was mailed to my home about a week later.  I went online and created an online account to register the card.  Registering the card allows you various options to add value to the cards online as well as the ability to manage multiple cards with one online account.  There are also fare machines at stations like Kipling where you can load your card or just simply check the balance.

Still, this new fare payment system is sorrily needed.  What it will replace on the TTC end is tokens, tickets and maybe perhaps cash?  We don't necessarily need to have cash fares anymore.  Many of the other transit systems on our continent simply don't use it.  The thing is the electronic form of paying fares has to work.  Failure and then it's chaos.  In reading the Ventra reviews and in fact writing my own, I get to know the gist of the system but I don't know it inside out.  You never really will know the backend or support of a system until you actually have to deal with it or engage the dreaded ""customer service"".  

I've dealt with Ventra customer service and I was satisfied with my results.  I haven't had to deal with Presto yet so I'll reserve to change this review if the need ever arises.  That being said I'll remain neutral for now.  Tokens will be gone, face the facts and get with this new card TTC ridership.  The days of automation are upon us and only now have we somewhat caught up to what cities like Washington, DC have had for 3 decades or so.

The main difference between Ventra and Presto I can think of is that Ventra's cards are actually credit cards.  With the CTA you don't have to own a Ventra card to use for their transit but rather you can use your own tappable card such as a debit card (aka bank access card) or your own credit card.  For people that aren't good with dealing with purchases, registering for things online etc this could be a difficulty.  For NYC's MTA cards (plastic fare card) can be anonymous and have no affinity to individuals while tickets (paper with mag strips) can't be used for transfers from subway to buses etc.  

With any main infrastructure change in a very large transit system, bumps are to be expected.  How the system integrates and how they treat these challenges is fully yet to be seen but the full over change is on the horizon so it can and will be eventually worked out because it has to and we don't have a choice.",2,3

There was a sizable cocktail list too, which I didn't get into, but it's good to know you can go here with your non-hoppy non-gluten buddies. 

The service was super friendly, helpful and easy going. The food was ok, the popcorn shrimp seemed fresh and light and I liked the salad they came with. The cheese burger had nice flavours but the fries had a strange mild after taste that I couldn't quite pinpoint but didn't love - maybe they are using an oil in the fryer that personally I don't like? Or a seasoning?

Of course the portions were twice as large back then, but what really stood out were the INSANE prices on the liquor and wine menu. I don't know who was running F&B back then, but their bottles of wine were literally half the price of other places and you could get a shot of Remy Martin VSOP for slightly over the cost you paid when you filled out those cheesy slips of paper with tiny pencils at the LCBO up on Dupont.

One upside is the rooms are huge!  It looks like a condo almost.  We had two connecting rooms and it perfectly accommodated a dozen inebriated grown men.  The bathrooms were clean and the beds we comfortable.  We had three couches combined on all two rooms with a dining table that we filled with beers, snacks, and liquor.

They had two excellent buffets downstairs. We opted for the classic buffet and for the price of $26, it was well worth it.  Go for the prime rib and the sirloin steak if you love meat.  They also had a section of decent Chinese food.  They have a 24-hour cafe that serves steak and eggs and good burgers.  One huge upside for me was they had a Coffee Bean right off the elevators.

One star got knocked off for the pools.  It was so SAD!  They closed really early for a Saturday and the music selection was horrible.  Plus it feels weird to swim around with beers next to the kiddies enjoying their summer vacation.

I was so enamored that I walked right by the ordering counter, although the service was very friendly when I did figure it out. 

I waited barely three minutes for my iced vanilla latte, served in a mason jar (obviously).

3,"What just happened?? I'm confused. O_o

I was dying to see this show for a while, so when me and my friends planned our last big Vegas trip, I made sure there was a budget to see this show. But now I'm not so sure if it was worth it. 

The theatre itself is gorgeous. Take a look at the ceiling. Its amazing. Of course, it's in Bellagio. It better look gorgeous! The stage is made of a huge pool for the acrobats to dive into. And there are mini stages coming up from below... behind... everywhere!

I opted for the wet seats in row 3 for maximum experience. Me and my friends got hit dead on with this splash/stream of water. Not very good when you're all dolled up ready for clubbing. The water even dripped into my shoes! Luckily, we had some napkins to dry ourselves. I guess that's what I get for getting seats that close to the stage. Get seats a little further away if you want to stay dry. 

The show itself was kind of confusing. The storyline was definitely lacking, so I sat there in confusion most of the time. But the stunts and costumes were amazing. They even have their own funny clowns (yes, like the ones with the red noses). This show is definitely good for people who are super into artistic flair. It can get slow at times though.

The show wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be though. Maybe it's because there didn't seem to be any sort of order or reason or things. It was more like a bunch of random acts put into a show. I think there's just so much hype about ""O"" that it almost sets itself up for disappointment. This show is kind of overrated, especially for the amount of money you have to shell out for the show. There are barely any to none discounts floating around for this show. 

Go watch this show if you've got some money to spare (the cheapest seats are $93.50!). I'd rather go watch Le Reve if I want to watch a Cirque Du Soleil water show.",3,1
0,"With all the hype here we decided to go tonight after my kid's Winter Concert, it was packed and we have to wait for about 20-25 minutes to grab a seat. The waitress ushered us nice and warm, and so With the  review saying the bulgogi stew and seafood pancake were great so I ordered it after much thought. The side dishes came first, and I must say it's the most variety I've seen so far out of the restos we've been through. It has kimchi , pickled radish, sausages, sautéed mushrooms, seaweed salad and lettuce . Pancake seafood cake next, it's thick , and not the thinner version I've been used to, it had too much flour and less seafood than I thought, more onions making it dry and not as tasty. The sauce isn't to the taste I've been expecting , seems diluted so as not to be spicy. Beef bulgogi stew came and was cooked a little later, serves 2-3 but I think it's For 4-5 people, nevertheless, they tried to make it quick. There's enoki mushrooms, tofu, beef, glass noodles and some fish on it. A little sweet broth with a hint of pepper. Altho I personally love the pork stew, this is a different twist altogether. It would have been great if not for the seafood pancake, but with the service and effort, plus the awesome side dishes, thus the 3 stars.",0,0
1,"This gem of a place is a popular go-to at lunch time for those working in the Yonge & Eglinton area.  With fresh & delicious daily specials to entice anyone's taste buds, I find myself here on a weekly basis for lunch.

Hannah's daily specials include a few option for soups, pasta dish and two 'main' dishes.  I usually get half size soup and half size pasta or a salad.

The soups here are AMAZING. Some of the best soups I've had here are: Moroccan Lentil Chick Pea Soup, Potato Avocado Soup, and Parsnip Sweet Potato Soup...just to name a few.

I die for all the different salads they have here as well.  They have the same menu for salads everyday - bowtie, couscous, beets, crab, pesto fusili, greek, chickpeas, spinach and garden.  I can't choose a favourite, because they're all tasty!  You've got to try them all.

 If you're not aware of this place, it's hands-down the best place for the Home Made Comfort Food that you must try.

Unfortunately with all the condo construction going on in this area, the entire block has been bought by a Condo Company and Hannah's will be closing its doors by 2014...  So, do try and get a piece of their yummy food before it's too late!

Tip: if you're like me and want to taste a bit of everything, go for the 1/2 portions!",1,1
0,"Eaten here a few times over the years. It's owned/run by actual New Yorkers (though not 100% sure if they're Italian) and the style of food reflects that. The pizza slices are thin, greasy and huge - REAL pizza - and then reheated in a brick oven to order as well as new pizza baked fresh throughout the day. I got two large cheese slices and a drink for less than $4. Good food, good deal.",0,0
6,"I walked out of this place $30 lighter and wound up eating maybe $5 worth of the food. Just ugh. The Sesame Inn doesn't have lo mein on the menu - WTF kind of Chinese restaurant doesn't have lo mein? - but the hostess (I was ordering takeout) recommended chow mein instead. The noodles were spaghetti noodles, not Chinese noodles. The sesame chicken was nothing more than a fried, sliced chicken breast with some kind of watery soy sauce on the side to pour over the top, absolutely no chili paste or thick sticky sauce. Egg rolls were doughy and had little flavor. I've had way better meals from cheapy Chinese places in NY that charge $5 a plate. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this crap. It gets two stars instead of one because the restaurant itself, from what I saw, was clean, quiet and nicely lit and the staff was nice.

I don't understand why it is so freaking impossible to find good Chinese food in the Valley that's not from a chain like Pei Wei. In the last several years we've managed to get good pizza places here - can we import some East Coast Chinese? Of course, I realized last night that if I thought the last six or so Chinese places I've eaten at were terrible, maybe the problem isn't them, maybe I just don't like Chinese anymore!

Nah. It's totally them.",5,1
2,"We come here pretty regularly because it's in our general area and my Dad really likes this place. What I would say about it is it's a great Pho place to go to and not get Pho. Sounds a little contradictory but I'll explain. I don't think their pho is exceptional. It is basic and simple but my parents seem to enjoy it very much. We've been to other pho places but they seem to like it the best (possibly out of convenience, I'm not really sure). While they often order pho, I will opt for other dishes. My current personal favorite is the Spicy Stir Fried Tofu with rice but I will often get the Spicy Stir Fried Chicken with Rice, the Pork Chop/Grilled Chicken with rice, or the vermicelli (with various toppings depending on my mood). If you want something very spicy, get the goat curry. It will make the manliest of men cry. You can always ask for less spicy or mild on their dishes and they are very accommodating to that. Service is always friendly. We come here often enough that they recognize us and strike up mild small talk which shows good service. The overall feel is very homey and cozy.

I don't necessarily think anything about this restaurant is necessarily exceptional, but it is convenient, the food comes out fast, and it is pretty cheap. They also have dishes I love that I can't get anywhere else so it does keep me coming back. I don't necessarily get excited to come here, but I am never disappointed leaving.

(Just a tip, get the Vietnamese Iced Drip Coffee with condensed milk. It is super sweet but if you really want to feel a kick in your heart beat, it'll definitely give you that.)",0,0

1,"The best carpet cleaning company I have ever had. He was very quick to respond and explained to me his prices and procedures needed to clean my carpet. He was upfront about the extra charge for stains I had on the phone, which is rare because other companies sometimes just like to upsell and charge you without even agreeing on the service. He texted me 30 minutes before arriving and was on time. He got done cleaning in 3 hours and made my carpet look brand new! He even asked if I would want extra treatment on all 3 rooms, which I said no and to do just one room with lots of stains.  I saved so much money hiring Arcane after getting quotes with other cleaning companies, and those companies still spam my email and phone. I was very happy with his knowledge and how personable he was. This guy knows how to treat your carpet and has the right tool. I recommend him and will keep using his service.",0,0
3,"Update:
I wanted to take a min & update my review to be fair. Once the local owner was made aware of my bad experience, he reached out to me to offer solutions. I truly appreciated his tone & politeness. He was willing to offer me a partial refund after researching the difference in time/cost of the two moves. He spent several minutes listening to my frustrations & explained that the 2 out of the 4 guys that are still employed will be talked to (though one was actually really nice & is only partially to blame bc he happened to be working as a group, not individually). I'm adjusting my star rating from a 1 to a 3, bc hopefully the company isn't as bad as this one move. We did after all have a great experience the first time around. My husband & I are considering booking again & will request a member of the original team. If that happens, I REALLY hope they will show me that my second experience was a fluke on a baddddd day & not the norm. 
I will update if/when we move & use All My Sons again. 

Do NOT use this company - you never know what kind of team you're going to get & it's not worth the gamble!!!!
I used this company about 2 years ago & had a great experience so I called them when we needed to move again this last August. FIRST MISTAKE! The crew showed up & made sure we understood their unhappiness with the size & organization of our household goods... even though I explained everything in great length to the person that booked me - that we were downsizing, I needed lots of my boxes stacked in the new garage, I was due to have a baby on the 13th & we were moving on the 15th - that being said, I would REALLY need the team to follow directions b/c I'd be in no condition to fix anything later or help much the day of. The booking guy said instead of 4 guys like the original move, we would be just fine with 3 since we were going from 2,300 sq ft to 1,200 AND the team would be there less time than the first team who took about 4 hrs. 
Lengthy discussion during booking aside, when the team arrived they had us call their office for another guy to come (bc apparently 3 men wasn't enough). They took almost twice as long as the first move with the exact same amount of items but with less to do b/c we had a lot of it going into the new garage, rather than into rooms. Well, even though I spent HOURS labeling boxes/bags & literally drawing diagrams for where things needed to be placed in the new house, they didn't follow any of it. In fact, when I tried to give verbal direction, each guy would pass the buck & would say ""oh, tell him"" & point to someone else. When I would go to the next guy, he'd nod, I'd walk away thinking the item was being properly placed, & I'd move on to the next item or sit down (remember, I just had a baby!).... but come to find out - NONE of them were listening or reading the labels!
We realized within a few days of trying to unpack that they totally screwed us by stacking random boxes in the wrong places. Boxes labeled ""upstairs kitchen"" were in the far corner of the downstairs garage under heavy tools & other random things. ""Nursery downstairs"" boxes were taken to the upstairs master. ""Garage crafts downstairs"" were left in the upstairs living room. It was AWFUL & b/c I physically couldn't lift anything - I was stuck without half of my household for 8 wks until I was cleared by my dr for physical activity. My husband & I were just now able to pull everything out of the garage, restack, & relocate everything today. 
The worst part of that day was that we were charged $1,200 (the first move was about $650). 
Like I mentioned before, b/c there were so many boxes due to going from such large house to a much smaller house that we didn't realize the full extent of how terrible of a job they did for several days - so when we were asked to rate the team's service, we gave him high marks & $25 tip each. I feel like a fool. 
As soon as we realized just how bad everything was, I called the local office to talk to a manager (less that a week later). I was directed to email a customer service person, which I did & sent pictures. No reply. I waited & called again-I was told it could take some time to get a reply. So I waited a few weeks, still no reply. I called again & was directed to talk to the operations manager. He didn't answer but I believe I spoke with a sales manager who told me that if I wanted to have my house fixed (I asked to have someone help me rearrange the garage bc I literally could not even fit my trash can in it & things were thrown around so crazy) & he said I'd have to pay $89 per hr. even after I explained the whole thing. He said the guys were probably following my directions & probably stacked the boxes the best they could in a small space. ""Probably"" - this man irritated me to no end. I didn't want to hear his ""probablys"" anymore. I was shocked that he wasn't even a little bit empathetic/ apologetic. He said he'd discuss it with the local owner & call me back, but no call c",0,0

We got there and they didnt seat us for 30mins. When there were tables. Then we got seated and didnt get the food for 1 and a half hours. 

We kept trying to grab the witress but she would avoid us. Then we would ask othe waitresses and they said the would check.

People were coming and going that got there after us!!!

Finally I got aggressive with our waitress and we saw her walk to the chef and put in our order!!!

She forgot to put in our order!!!

Since she wanted to pretend like it was just taking a long time she fucked the whole order up because she was going off memory and couldnt ask us because then we would know.

The food came finally and it was all crap we didnt even order!!!

We told her to forget the whole thing we are leaving and not paying.

She grabbed her manager who told us. 

""she is on thin ice with the owner who is right there. I can take it off the bill but there is a good chance we will get her fired. Or the waitress will pay for half out of her pocket""

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!

Of course I told her the whole meal needs to be free and it was extremely unprofessional that she would blame a waitress getting fired because we waited a total of 2 hrs for the wrong meals we didnt eat!!

It would have been rated a zero star but I gave it 2 because now they are a bar too and that portion is pretty cool.",6,6
1,"One thing I have found particularly worrying about Toronto as a travel destination is how predominantly Eaton Centre is mentioned as a tourist attraction. It's just a mall for Pete's sake and even a particularly great one. 

Edmonton Mall had their run as the world's largest mall once-upon-a-time, with their roller coaster and water park but they are a two trick town. Is either that, the Calgary Stampede or endless fields of wheat. Your pick. 

We have a bit more history and I would hope more to see than a mall. Since as far as malls go, Eaton's is nothing exceptional. It had the distinction of being the stronghold of the Eaton's empire before it got bought out. Leaving us with next to no Canadian institutions. Seriously, what do we got left? The Bay is long gone, Timmy's is American and we got no mayor beer breweries. Canadian Tire, that's it... and the banks.

Alas, if anything this mall is just long. Sure the glass dome over the two buildings lends itself for copious amounts of natural light and might make for a great photo of two. Specially with the flying Geese... What does everyone have a thing for the geese?

But the stores in there are no different than anything else you would find at Square One or Yorkdale. I guess it just depends on your budget. For example, my store of choice for regular clothing was the Mexx which has dozens of locations all across town.

Sure you can come in a pretty much find almost anything you need, it doesn't mean that you have to come here though. Since they do charge for parking plus, as mentioned before, this place is generally not as busy as it looks since most of the pedestrian traffic is people coming/exiting subway stations. 

Personally I have not bought anything in this mall in years. However I walked it yesterday and I think I am far, far from the only one.",0,0
28,"Not gonna lie, I wasn't the biggest fan of Pita Bistro. Everything I ate was a little bland and really not that satisfying. Sad, I know. 

This is a conveyor belt style, fast casual spot. You choose your main vehicle - wrap, salad, bowl type deal, choose your protein, toppings and sauces and boom. 

I went with a create your own chicken shawarma salad and I've had a lot better. The chicken itself was flavorless. Not dry, not especially juicy, but zero spice. The salad wasn't fresh and juicy, but seemed rather like it was straight from a ginormous bag. This isn't boding well.

The toppings were fresh, but nothing added any flavor to this dish that desperately needed it. I opted for some hot sauce, hummus and tzatziki and the desired income of flavor was missed, instead making a pile of flavorless mush. It was a whole lot of meh, not gonna lie. A bite of my friend's falafel sealed the deal. Far from the real thing and really dry. 

I however will still give this spot three stars. Why? Because I know really good Mediterranean and maybe others don't. Also, this place has a ton of seating and is quite nice for a rather casual lunch. And, I can't hat that they are offering up healthy eats from the salads and bowls to the fresh juices. 

Not the worst $11 lunch, but I can tell ya, I've definitely had way better shawarma, hummus and all that jazz.",11,21

Myself and another individual unfortunately were in the car wash when the wash stop and made our vehicles run into each other.

I am emailing to follow-up with issue that occurred at our Cave Creek and Beardsley locations.  I have also spoken to the staff and a concerned customer.   

......


In regards to the issue that occurred, Cobblestone's maintenance team has looked into the issue and was not able to find anything out of the ordinary. We also have consulted with the manufacture to determine how this issue occurred. At this time Cobblestone and the manufacture has not been able to determine a cause. I am glad to hear from Chelsea and Guillermo that there was not damage to any of the vehicles involved.

 
It is Cobblestones reasonability to keep our staff and customers safe. Unfortunately, this issue appeared to escalate pretty quickly to an unprofessional level. Cobblestone is in the process of retaining our staff on how to better handle these issues in a professional manner.

 
Cobblestone has always gone above and beyond to keep customers experience great even when it was not Cobblestone fault or there was some doubt, we usually side with the customer.

Then great service ended. 

The tech spend less than 10 minutes here. And charged me $49 and did nothing. 

On the first refrigerator he said we needed to replace the defrost (light bulb) he called it. It would cost $195 plus parts. He said if it was defrosted it would take him about 10 minutes to replace. He said the part was approximately $80-$100. Way too pricy for 10 minutes of work. 

On the 2nd refrigerator the water and ice flapper was broken. The tech claims that the part was no longer made and if he could find it, it would be with the complete dispenser housing. It would cost $29 for just the flapper pad, but closer to $100 for the complete housing. Also it would cost $165 to work on it plus the parts. 

As soon as the tech left I went on line, found the flapper part in less than 5 minutes and it cost only $4.04. I ordered the part, shipped it next day, and then replaced it myself in less than 10 minutes. It only cost me $21.17 total.

Margaritas were really good except they were out of the organic ingredients for the organic margarita I ordered off the menu.  I had a house margarita and a Sangria margarita and they were both excellent.  Not sure worth the $29 price but they were good.

Salsas were odd, it was a blend of 3 sauces.  The citrus/cilantro blend was good, the others were odd tomato pastey runny dips.  We ordered guac which was better than the salsas.

I was disappointed by the menu to see nothing vegetarian, so I ordered the tostadas w/out the meat that it comes with.  They were pretty good.

Service was terrible.  Our waiter was pushy, even convincing us to get margaritas to go to take w/us to the pool (he didn't mention we weren't supposed to take them into the pool area...  we had to smuggle them in).  It took forever to order and get the missing silverwear and then when someone in our group spilled water into one of our chip baskets it was a big ordeal to find someone to request (and then wait) for more.

1,"I think this grade is probably too low, but it honestly represents my first experience at DeSano's.  If we go back I'm confident it will go up.

The ambiance is not what I expected at all, very minimalist and open with wooden tables and long benches throughout and a stone floor. The focus is on the kitchen which is wide open and the two giant wood-burning ovens.  I really liked it.  It screamed - it's all about the food.  It gets a little loud since there is nothing to absorb the sound, but nothing too bad.

The bar was very limited in beers at the moment, only 3 on tap. Some wines as well.

The service was... interesting.  You order at the front and pay right away and they give you an electronic device to let you know when the pizza is ready.  Then they deliver the pizza to your  table.  It was not very crowded despite being a Saturday night when we came in.  We ordered and asked how long it would take and they told us 10 minutes or so.  So we went to the bar and got drinks and then sat down.  Ten minutes became fifteen became twenty, became twenty-five.  Finally one of the servers asked us what we had ordered because she noticed us sitting there for so long (again, it wasn't crowded).  It turns out that somehow they hadn't made our pizza.  They blamed the error on a new employee they were training. Whatever.

To their credit they brought us out some meatballs, tomato sauce and bread to snack on which was very welcome because we were quite hungry at that point.  Unfortunately, they rushed our pizza.  We ordered a Napoletana pizza with broccoli rabe, mozzarella de bufala and sausage.  But it came out undercooked, white across the bottom rather than charred.  The pizza itself was good (although I wish I had realized that it was the only pizza on the menu without tomato sauce! that one's on me) and the quality of the ingredients was apparent.  I love the sweet/salty sausage contrasted with the bitterness of the broccoli rabe.  However, undercooking and rushing the pizza out really compounded their initial mistake of not putting in our order.

1,"We've been here a couple times since the annual sale started (day after Christmas). Last night was our most recent visit. And my, my, my, the stock was dwindling down, and I was wondering why there wasn't an elbow-room fight at the sale bra sections (nah, seriously, sometimes it can be brutal). When I found what I was looking for, I finally know which ones are ideal for me, YAY, and went to the line, that was the a-ha! Well, everyone was in line because there were only two cashiers (*there was a couple other ladies, but they left to sort out the floor, or something). So it was a half hour, but it didn't seem that long (OK, my hubby might disagree with me on this one- he wasn't the only one, there were quite a few other husbands in there, waiting, hahaha, it's a good thing we ladies are loved). 

This one might be smaller than most locations, but you can still find some great deals here, if you are lucky, and find those sale bras in your size. The line wraps through the beauty and scent department, so it is like any other store, having some items to catch your attention near the counter, so you can spend some more $$$ (it's a ploy, but it's an effective one; if it wasn't, it wouldn't be replicated over and over). 

The ladies working (Holly was one of them) here were super nice last night. I got two greetings from two different ladies. And the cashier (blonde, hair was up, smoky eyes) was super nice, too. I wanted to tell her that her makeup was gorgeous- it really highlighted her best features, but sometimes people may think you are weird, if you say things like that, when you are a stranger (but I have always paid clerks compliments, I remember as a little girl, telling my mom to tell the lady she was pretty, I'm pretty real like that. I'm not a competition kind of girl.) 

Anyway, I've been to a few other VS locations around town. And the importance of great customer service really shines here. It really makes a difference in your shopping experience (Can I get a what- what?!)when people in customer service enjoy their jobs. I wanted to mention this, because it's lacking in other places (*and you know about that too*, when I do my reviews, I like to keep it real).",2,1

By far some of the best pizza I've had and I'm lucky enough to have it right here in my little town. Best pizza in vegas is actually in Boulder City",0,0
3,"Just came for a few drinks before dinner.

A Bar and Kitchen is located in an Alley, but there is plenty of signage to announce it's location (and a parking structure and lot near by).

The atmosphere is really nice.  It's casual without being sloppy, but also a little on the upscale side.

The menu consisted of a few sandwiches, burgers, salads, pasta, chicken, seafood and steak.  There appears to be something for everyone...  They also have a nice appetizer selection and their happy hour specials included certain amounts off of beer, cocktails and ""bar snacks"".

I ended up getting their ""Downtown Donkey"" which is basically a Moscow Mule.  I liked the Ginger Beer they used and asked the bartender about it (I like to make them at home).  He mentioned it was Goya brand.  I had never had it before, but it was a little spicier than other ginger beers (which I like).  I would recommend.

I also ended up getting ""An Apple of My Eye"" which is cider reduction, muddled fruit and rye.  It was a little tarter than I like in my drinks (but it's not exactly cider season), but if you like bourbon, I would say give it a shot.

The bartenders were pretty nice and attentive.

I would say it's worth a stop!",1,3
0,"This place is worth considering if you have big dogs  that most places consider ""restricted breeds."" I lived here for 3 years and it was decent. Yes, it's old and not HGTV picture worthy. Yes, there is poop everywhere, but it's due to the lazy owners. I feel bad for the maintenance guys having to pick up after them. Yes, their ""gym"" is a hidden closet with two machines in it. And yes there were a few instances where we felt unsafe (two shootings over a course of three years, some jackass lit illegal fireworks on random night near our cars, no security). But the unrestricted dog breeds, location and price made it worth it. Not sure what rent is now but we paid 1100 for a pretty spacious 2br/2ba with a dog fee. We were also on the west side of the complex in the far back facing a neighborhood. It seems to be much quieter on the west side of the complex closer to Grand Canyon so try to ask for that side or at least get a unit in the far back away from Sahara. Maintenance guys are always busy but they've never missed a scheduled appt and have always fixed our issues. Girls in the office are nice enough - never had issues with them. Can't say enough about the location. Its perfect. You can walk to the markets, restaurants and movie theater. Also super close to downtown summerlin and the vegas ballpark. So if you have pitbulls, rotweilers, dobermans, great danes, etc and are pretty low maintenance and want to live in a great area, definitely consider this place! For those looking for a posh and modern place with all the amazing amenities, keep looking.",0,0
9,"So, i'll caveat this review with the fact that I'm an American, so maybe I'm just too uptight for canadian Crossfit. 

Here's the scene-- i'm in town with a friend and looked for a box that i can go for the week. We buy the unlimited week package. 

We get there-- and are greeted by Crossfit 416's only redeeming quality-- the front desk guy, Gus. He was super helpful, while Rachel was not on the phone, and found us a cheaper option for the week. 

We check in, and head to the back. We are greeted by no one, and there were three coaches back there, Luke, Rachel, and Daniele. I had to introduce myself to Luke, and ask ""Hi, are you the coach? My friend and I are visiting for a class."" He said ""yes."" That's it. No question of my fitness ability or Crossfit experience. 

Then, as we were doing the strength portion of the class, the only ""coaching"" we received from Luke was negative. It was clear to me that during his L1, he learned that the only way to coach is provide negative feedback, and ZERO positive feedback. As two experienced Crossfit athletes, i'm certain there was SOME aspect during our one-hour session that he could have praised. Instead, it was all negative. At one point, he told us ""don't be afraid to bend into the swing"" while we were doing double KB Russian swings. WHAT? No where have i ever been told to bend into a KB swing. 

Why Luke was so critical, yet had zero questions about our experience confuses me. But, it was clear that he didn't care about safety. 

The shitiness of this gym didn't end at the coaching though-- when the next class came in, there was a guy, Ramzi, warming up with kettlebells. One girl thought he was getting too close to the group, and ACTUALLY PUSHED HIM while he was swinging 70lbs of weight. They got into a verbal altercation, and Ramsey told the girl passionately that he ""wished she would die"", and made some very strange comment about the fact that ""God does not exist"".

1.) Who pushes someone swinging heavy weight?
2.) What the hell, Ramzi?
3.) Where are the coaches managing this altercation?

My friend and I decided not to return to Crossfit 416 and just work out in the hotel gym. 

Oh wait, i lied-- other than Gus, the other redeeming quality of Crossfit 416 is the soft shirts. Yeah, we bought one to commemorate that time we went to the worst caricature of a box ever.",14,2

5,"I love pizza. Not in the ""I'm a pizza snob and thus only eat at gourmet places"" etc. pizza-hipster sense... I mean in the ""If it's pizza, I probably love it"" kind of way. I'm very hard to disappoint in that regard. That being said, I'm not a fan of the Pizza Hut chain at all. I've always found they charge more than most places for an inferior product, and have a terrible track record of customer service.

Recently, however, I found myself hanging out with an excessively attractive girl, and I have a hard time saying no to that particular subset of the human race. She really wanted stuffed crust, sooooo... Pizza Hut it was.

I paid roughly 50% more than I usually do through a place like Domino's or my local mom & pop place for a 2 large pizza (or comparable) combo... and got one medium (and this is before delivery charges, additional debit charges, etc.) Already, I'm less than impressed. The driver was late and incredibly rude. The debit terminal was poor quality and required 3 attempts to work properly... and then, when all was said and done, we opened the box to find the most disappointing thing I have ever seen called a pizza in my life.

About 1/3 of the surface area of this thing was crust, so what little toppings, sauce and cheese we got was relegated to the first couple bites of each slice, and even then it was all very thin. In fact, ""thin"" was the perfect word for this thing. The dough had been over-stretched to the point that each piece was falling apart as we picked it up. It's a good thing my dinner partner liked stuffed crust, cause that was about 3/4 of the food we got.

I literally don't think any pizza has ever been this disappointing in my life... and that includes the one that made me seriously ill.

$30 for about a tablespoon of pizza sauce, a little handful of cheese and toppings, thrown on what appeared to be somebody trying to make a pita bread out of pizza dough, surrounded by the worst cheesy bread stuff I've ever had in my life.

Yeah, that's never happening again.",2,1

1,"Having heard about other escape places not meeting expectations, I was always lacklustre about trying one, though I am a fan of the games, since way back in the days of Maniac Mansion, Leisure Suit Larry, Day Of The Tentacle, etc. (if you don't know what those titles are then you need to stop playing those iPhone games and experience the grand daddy of escape games!)

Omescape promised high production and clever puzzles and they delivered! The room was themed decently, but had good strong mechanics, no random hidden clues, and a story-driven mystery.

They also have a drinks bar and board game area with plenty of seating for gaming. Their selection of games were very good, with lots of popular and award winning games that even the true hard core gamers will recognize like Pandemic, Istanbul, Zombicide, 7 Wonders, etc...

Haven't tried their drinks yet so no comments there.

1,"Amazing company for escape rooms. My team did 2 rooms back to back - Lost & Found in Chinatown and Escape from the Time Travel Lab. Both very immersive and thematic. 

Lost & Found in Chinatown is a very different type of escape room - more like a scavenger hunt. Slightly tiring but nevertheless, still had a blast. Excellent game for friend/team bonding! The puzzles were not too challenging but this was more focused as a scavenger hunt. Tip, bring some cold beverages with you as we got really dehydrated near the end. I would rate this 4/5.

Escape from the Time Travel Lab was my personal favorite between the two. Very cool concept with great actors. The only downside was we had to do the escape with ransoms. Good thing we had a solid team but we went with 10 people and it got slightly too hectic. I think 8 people would be an ideal size. This room had some challenging puzzles but there were actors to guide you. The actors were great as they add thematic value to the game. I highly recommend this room - 5/5!

The employees & actors are also really friendly and funny. They were nice enough to explain the solution to puzzles we weren't able to solve.

For those that don't know, the Las Vegas Half and Full Marathon are at night, so we were eating dinner probably at like 10pm. I was actually surprised at the modern, upscale interior of Buddy's. I was expecting a layout similar to an Olive Garden or Buca di Beppo, but this place is definitely higher end. 

We were seated near a window, which we really enjoyed because we got to people watch down below and see people finishing the marathon.

Although we were worn out, we needed to refuel. As much as I normally would have loved a glass of wine at this kinda place, I stuck with water since I felt dehydrated. I ordered a side Caesar salad for starter and the spaghetti for my main meal. 

The Caesar was okay. The dressing wasn't as flavorful and the croutons are really weird. They are not your normal croutons. They are soft and essentially taste like funnel cake. I didn't love that but what do you expect from a pastry chef? I only finished maybe half the salad.

The spaghetti was good. I enjoyed the sauce and the overall flavor was good. Although, it was nothing to write home about. Pretty baseline spaghetti.

All in all, this place is a pretty standard Italian restaurant with an upscale, modern feel. Their price points are very reasonable and it's seated at a great location, so if you're looking for a non-chain place in Las Vegas, this might be a good option for you.",0,0

I pointed it out and they scrubbed and rubbed at it several times before declaring it a chip. 
I asked the man helping me to order new lenses. That is when a salesperson named Justin strode over, inspected the glasses and declared the chip too small to matter.

I came here during Winterlicious and it was only a $10 discount per person but still. If you check in with your Yelp app, you can get 10% off...not sure if you can stack it on top of the Winterlicious price, I didn't bother asking.

My reservation was for a Sunday night and there was live music which I actually really liked. But that was because our table was at the back near the kitchen so it wasn't loud for us. The atmosphere is definitely more homey/family-friendly than the downtown location. It felt like we were at a pub with the live music. 

The food was good, however, for the first 30 minutes, literally no one came around to our table with the meat. We had to flag down one of the gauchos and even then he said that he had to go his section and couldn't help us at that moment. They definitely wanted us to stock up on our carbs and on the buffet. Our waitress was great, she continually asked us if we had any requests. Every time she asked, I told her I wanted the bacon-wrapped filet mignon, salmon, and the Moroccan chicken. She was very attentive and came back quite frequently to ask if we had received any of the requests, and we had not! I literally did not get my filet mignon or Moroccan chicken until I was completely full and pretty much right before we were about to pay. I only got the salmon, filet mignon, and Moroccan chicken once during our meal. I like the downtown location's Moroccan chicken and salmon seasoning more than this location. Some of the steaks were over-cooked.

It's unfortunate that the service only improved/the meat started coming around near the end of our meal when we were already full. Overall, I prefer the downtown location over this one and I would only come back here for the Winterlicious/Summerlicious price.",0,0

I ordered the Buckwheat Pancakes with a side of sausage (regular), and coffee. The buckwheat stack is served with Ohio honey, lightly sweetened whip cream and granola. I appreciate the use of local ingredients. They were good, but not as great as I had anticipated. The sausage had a unique flavor, but wasn't for me. The coffee looked weak but was actually pretty good. My friend ended up ordering a bunch of individual sides to make a meal - I like the flexibility, but also find it odd that it was necessary.

7,"Do. Not. Come. For. The. Coffee.

Even though there is a special stand-up card on every table speaking sooooo highly about the quality of the restaurant's coffee and it's super special artisanal-ness, it was burnt swill. I drink coffee rarely anymore so when I decide to have a cup I'm very selective. After reading said little stand up card I thought, surely for all this marketing, there must be something to the coffee here. Not so much. It was worse than the burnt roasts at Starbucks. And to be fair - in case the particular pot that poured my cup had sat too long - I requested a new cup from a fresh pot. Same thing. Even the manager that I spoke with after the meal rolled his eyes when I talked about the coffee and basically said it had the quality of gasoline.

But I get ahead of myself. Let's return to the beginning because the coffee is not alone in the mediocrity that was Snooze that day.

When you come during a busy time, expect a wait. That doesn't bother me at all - the bustle of an exciting and popular restaurant and a little wait tells me that many folks are happy to be eating there - and it's usually an indication of great quality food and service. Once a table became available, we did get stuck in a back corner next to a pile of high chairs, the swinging back patio door, and under an air conditioning fan. The only thing that saved me from freezing was the regular opening of the door letting in the warm summer air as servers went in and out. So not the best table and not the best climate control, but all in all that wasn't going to get us down.

The restaurant was slammed. I might also say that during busy hours, Do. Not. Come. For. The. Service. It's so disappointing that we as patrons should need to avoid certain hours of the day because waitstaff whose job it is to know how to wait tables properly during their ENTIRE SHIFT simply cannot manage to hold it together when it's time to MOVE QUICKLY AND SMARTLY.

Our server couldn't manage that. We waited for someone to take our first drink order (that lovely coffee) an unreasonable amount of time. Once she showed up, she was distracted and never once looked us in the eye. Every interaction with her during the visit found her constantly looking ahead to her next task, her next stop - so much so that she seemed to already be gone from the table by the time she got there. And to top it off, she put on the fake sugary patronizing voice that makes it SOUND like she cared about what was being asked for, but her mind was elsewhere. And when we did ask for something - cream, natural sugar - it took an unreasonable amount of time to receive it.

It's unfortunate that now I can't remember much about the food. I think it was fine - maybe even inventive. I might have had a Benedict (?) with an interesting rendition of asparagus (?). I think my husband enjoyed whatever he ate too. I waited too long to write this review for starters, but my memory of the food is eclipsed by the poor service and the supercilious attitude of our server.

But then there was also this.

Two women were seated at about the same time next to us. They ordered pancakes (JUST PANCAKES) and REQUESTED the pancakes be cooked well in the middle. This order was taken right around the time of our coffee order. Their pancakes arrived right around the time our food order was taken. The pancakes were RUNNY in the middle. They sent them back.

The server that was working with them didn't apologize, didn't assure them that it would be made right, didn't demonstrate care one way or the other that the kitchen messed up or that she put crap food down for two people she's supposed to be caring for. Her attitude was rather that she was terribly inconvenienced by the whole thing and it now threw a wrench into her works.

Our food came. We ate - leisurely and talking. Out of the corner of my eye I watched the table next to us. They sat. And waited. We ate. And talked. They waited some more. No one came to tell them it would ""be just a few more minutes and we're so sorry for the mix up"". At one point someone came and delivered a side of bacon. OF BACON! They had the balls to slap down a side and run away when the main course wasn't even present. Poor, poor, POOR SERVICE.

We finally finished our meal. The pancakes finally showed up. It had to have been 20-30 minutes later. For pancakes, people. Pancakes. A 6-10 minute dish and you couldn't be bothered to get it together and treat these women well.

Pitiful.

We paid. And after stopping to express my apologies to the women for how they were treated at Snooze, I went straight to the manager to tell him just how piss-poor their service was. (And how the coffee was burnt swill.) To his credit, he said he would make it right immediately and he was confident the ladies would be happy by the time they left. I really hope that meant comping their entire bill.

Do better, Snooze. You're not ""all that"".",2,0

I have been coming here since they opened and in the past I felt this place was a well deserved 3+ stars.  My how times have changed.  The past 4-5 times I have been here the service has just been awful.  We came with a friend 2 weeks ago and she was appalled at how she was consistently ignored  only because she asked for water to start and then she wasn't followed up on the rest of the night.  The food is decent, the beer prices are high but the service is 0 stars.  On our last and final trip here we came in and sat down waiting 10-15 minutes with no acknowledgement.  I finally got ready to order from the bar when a waitress that had passed us several times comes by and says, this table is taken you will have to move they are outside smoking.  No apology, no nothing....just get up.  The table was empty and there was no indication anyone had been sitting there. I told her we had been sitting there 10-15 minutes waiting to order and she just walked away not caring.  Had this been a one time thing u could understand, but the service is so bad that I will not return.  Too bad this place isn't close to what it used to be.",2,1

The best thing about La Salsa is that the restaurant is in planet Hollywood/miracle mile which has FREE PARKING. $4.95 for potatoes, eggs, two tortillas, and sausage or bacon. $0.99 for a tiny Bloody Mary. 
Everything tasted like a microwaveable breakfast which made the under $5 breakfast equivalent to something you can get at 7-11. Plus tax and tips, it might be more worth to stop by a convenience store on the way home",0,0

That was a full star deduction for that, make it easy for customers to find you!!  I really wanted BBQ so I took the effort to sort it out.  The food was delicious, I would have preferred to sit and eat but took it to go instead so the sauce wasn't put on the wings.  I ordered brisket, ribs, and wings.....all were good but not as fresh as I would have liked, just a slight deduction for that.  The service was awesome, I was able to order and get out rather quick.

0,"I was dining in your restaurant on Sunday morning May 26 for breakfast around 10 am. I was seated at the bar near the kitchen. After a few minutes of not being greeted, I had to ask one of the several waitresses for some coffee and water. Other patron's food orders to the right of me were taken, but mine was not. The waitress came back to the other patron's to check on them, and it was the person to the right of me that mentioned to the waitress I needed someone to take my order. I felt embarrassed having another patron I don't even know asking for someone to wait on me.

I placed my order with her, a full house with eggs over medium and hash browns well done...or crispy as she said to me. She came back to me a few seconds later to confirm my order again and I stated eggs over medium and crispy hash browns.

The shortly thereafter order came out, delivered by someone else. I had to ask for butter and syrup for the pancakes and only received butter squares that obviously have been sitting out for a long time. I had to ""borrow"" the syrup from the patrons to the right. 

Aside from this customer service issue, the eggs were extremely runny, not even close to over medium, and the hash browns were not crispy as ordered. I decided to cut my losses so to speak, eat the food presented to me and leave. I understand not everything goes perfect and certainly understand when times are busy, things can slip. However, there were many employees coming and going from the area as the kitchen is right there and as far as I am concerned, everything was wrong with my experience. I was not even offered a cup of coffee to go as I had been in past experiences.",0,0

We were here at a super busy weekend (manny vs mayweather fight). But the hotel still ran smoothly. The pools was nice and lots of chairs to sit on. Loads of restaurants and shops and the sky train is a life saver. It prevents you from wasting your energy from walking to the strip.

The only downfall is the room. It didn't look like the picture. Bummer. The x3 suite are old and outdated, would've love to have the exact room in the picture. :) oh well. Still had a good time. Will definitely be back and rent a room here again if the price is right.",0,0

Yes, they have stuff that's not pancakes. But who comes to IHOP for a cheeseburger or a fish and chips platter? I mean, really!

Service seems a little hit and miss.

I love their cookie flavors : cookie's & cream, vanilla wafer, chocolate chip cookie flavors but I'm a big fan of their mint flavors. Mint used to be one of their staple flavors but when I went last time, it wasn't an option :(

The bouncers are super nice, and there is free snacks right when you enter. But thats pretty much all the positives I can think of during my last visit. 

What really made the whole experience a disaster was the music. My first few visits the music was great - top 40s and EDM, house... Now they literally played the rush hour & star trek soundtrack? Lol how do people vibe and dance to that at a nightclub? & every time a good song did come on (which wasn't often btw) only the chorus was played and then it'll switch to another song on the rush hour sound track.

Basically it's an indoor maze with four hidden treasures you must find.  It was our first experience and even though we read mixed reviews you really have to go and have your own experience.  Fun is subjective and if you set your mind to have nice, clean fun you will make it an enjoyable experience.

We had a great time and worked together to find these treasures.  It took us 1 hour and 15 mins to figure it all out.  Families this is a great place for your kids to enjoy.  There were tons of families there and you can sense the excitement.  

I'm not sure how SOS keeps the maze new or how often they update the paths but affording yourself a visit is fun.  

Cons: in my opinion SOS needs to update their restrooms that was pretty bad.  Just a complete remodel is needed. 

Good luck SOS and thanks for the experience.",0,2

This review is based on All You Can Eat of the Chuan Chuan Bar

WARNING: CRAZY strong smell will be left on your cloths, jackets, hair, bags, my friends washed hair twice and still cannot get the smell away

The restaurant has recently changed from $0.5 a skewer to All you can eat:
Mon-Thurs: $27.99
Fri-Sun: $29.99

Reservation is strongly recommended for weekend as walk in might need to wait 30 mins to an hour during weekend rush hour

Soupbase: 
$10.99 for most soup bases, spicy soup base $19.99, and 19.99 for half and half with any choice

Environment: 
The restaurant is pretty small compare to other hot pot places, and depending on where you sit, there might be people beside you picking skewers, or mixing sauces

Service: 
The service is VERY good, they are always attentive, and resolve your request quickly, however I do think they need 1 to 2 more staff just to handle the rush hour as they all seems extremely busy and sometimes you cannot get a hold of them

Food:
Skewers are all stored in a glass fridge, and they are really tiny, no wonder they were getting bad reviews when it's $0.5 per skewer, taste is decent for most items but nothing stands out, and a fair amount items were sold out or never available, and some of the skewers take a good while for the kitchen to refill, especially during rush hour, some items we only got to taste once",1,0
0,"I switched from my previous property manager to Golden West three years ago for my house in Tempe and am very glad I made the switch.  In those three years I have never had a problem with the property or their management, a marked difference from what I experienced with my last company.  

They have always been prompt and professional in their communications with me.  If there was an maintenance issue with the property they immediately notified me so I could get it fixed in a timely manner and kept me in the loop the entire time.  Whenever we had a change over in tenant, the house was quickly rented due to their proactive advertising efforts.

I highly recommend Nelly, Lauren, Jessica and the entire team at Golden West if you are looking for a hassle free experience with a rental property.",0,0

My daughter is a hair stylist in NoDa and asked if I'd go with her to grab some french pastries on her lunch break. I was so delighted by the atmosphere with chandeliers and colorful decor. They have plenty of parking and many delicious pastries, sandwiches, soups, quiches and salads to offer! I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to see the whole menu however I believe they also offer a great selection of coffee and beverages. My fruit tart was amazing! The only complaint I have is that it was very busy and the line was really long so it took awhile just to order food, then had to wait for it to be prepared and brought out to us. We spent 30 minutes in total, and was only expecting a quick 10-15 minute stop to grab some take out. If you are in a rush, be sure to allow a little more time to get thru the line, and I'm sure they are always very busy at the lunch hour, which is when I went. Will definitely go again and next time I'll plan to stay a bit longer and also try a hot coffee latte.",0,0

As is sometimes the case with small little up-and-coming joints, the place was extremely well staffed, I hate waiting up front and not being greeted right away, especially at a new place where i am not exactly sure what the deal is.  

Finally we were sat, and although the place looks great, I did find my seat to be a bit uncomfortable.

Well, once we got settled in, the real joy of PB came to life, the food.  Although we passed on vino, the wine list looked fresh and reasonably priced.  Our appetizer of butternut squash lightly battered and stuffed with cream cheese was unique and amazing - even the greens it was served on had a light, yet tasty vinnegrette which balanced perfectly.

Our Pasta was great as well, My wife's gnocchi had a perfectly balanced red sauce with an amazing fennel finish.  My Orecchiete was loaded with fresh sausage and used the one piece of bread to sop up every last bit of sauce.

The hand rolled pasta was nice and although I would call PB cheap I left fully satisfied.

Our who remained busy throughout did stop to engage us enough to more than redeem the slow start.  Most importantly he seemed genuinely proud of his place and his product.

They will talk you out of spicy, but if you can eat a Jalapeno then you will be fine.

Food comes out in a bucket, and a steam bag. I dug in, and the crab tasted delicious. What I didn't know and what set this dinner into orbit was take a hunk of meat and slam it into the bottom of the steam bag where the juices are....FLAVOR BOMB!!.

I quickly poured out the butter dish, and poured in the juice from the bag. Corn was over boiled, but I don't eat corn, just sampled some from my awesome girl friends plate. Bread was good, sampled that too! I'm not a carb eater, so don't take my word for it. Everything had flavor and it was awesome.

Walking in you feel as if they're trying too hard and as if you're walking into someone's home. Like, yo we get that it's family owned. There's no need to plaster pictures of the owners and owners family all over the walls. A couple pictures cool. 20 or so pictures comes across excessive.

The coffee itself is creative but lacks that certain something. I don't know if it's the roasters they use or how the combination of ingredients are blended but it just doesn't work.

Even their website states that the cheapest room is 65 bucks. I think it's about time they take down the misleading $49 claim.

You must stay in this hotel only if you're absolutely broke. In my case I did a drop-in, but should you want a deal on a downtown hotel, I think you're better off using Hotwire, Booking.com or Hotels.com to get an acceptable rate for a prime spot hotel a day or two in advance.

The check-in was painfully slow. The gentleman was very courteous but even though I tried to make things simple by paying cash, it felt like it took 15 min or so to get my keys.

The condition of the building is very run down and not welcoming at all. Once I stepped inside the room, I noticed the ripped carpet and chipped paint on most surfaces. I did not find any heating switch/dial whatsoever. The bathroom was not particularly clean either. The suspicious characters walking in and out of the building were hard to miss too.

I ended up paying 75 dollars for a room that had a single and a double bed, but I'm sure 75 bucks can get you a more presentable place in the downtown core. I suggest you do your homework online, visit discount sites or use some last-minute booking apps on your phone before you check in here.",0,0

Our server Nate was really attentive but also allowed us to enjoy our meal without bombarding our table every 5 minutes. We sat further back in the restaurant which was nice because it was still light outside and there are a lot of windows in the front - being tucked back there was a darker and more intimate.

Started off with the charcuterie plate. And a couple glasses of the Sonoma Chard. I'm not joking the meat + cheese portion was soooo small. One roll of prosciutto, and two slices of the thinnest coppa I've ever seen, there was a nice amount of the duck pate (my personal fav) so that was nice. Cheese - blue cheese, taleggio (so yum but just not enough), and the other two were firmer cheeses' and clearly not memorable. There were more toppings (d. mustard, cornichons) then there was meat + cheese. So there's that.

For entrees we both choose the Cobb (salads aren't my usual choice but it was super hot outside and I wanted greens) comes with grilled chicken. I expected it to be warm and sliced chicken. But it was cold and in chunks, which makes me question its freshness. My bf subbed the chicken for steak, cooked to a perfect med-rare temp. Surprisingly the up-charge for the steak was only $6 (about 4oz filet)

Usually when there is too many choices I start to feel a slight panic - I always want to check everything out to make sure I chose the best of whatever it is.  Here, all the staff are extremely knowledgeable about the teas and what works best with what you like.

They also have a card program and you get a free tea on your bday month!  It's the small things that make the difference.

David's also sell tea equipment - mugs, infusers, tea pots etc.  They also have some new tea insufed vegan beauty products, but I haven't tried those out yet.  I think they should stick to tea to be honest.  

The prices vary and I would think you can easily expect to pay around $8-12 for 50grams of tea.  They also sell mulit packs which is great if you want to try a variety of teas but don't want to go broke.  So sip away....",0,1
5,"This is my first yelp review, and only because I have never been so dissatisfied with a company. I wish I hadn't made the decision to live here. My car was towed today. It had the sticker in the window that allowed for covered parking but since my registration had lapsed a month, and I hadn't moved it in 24 hours, it was towed. I understand it is my responsibility to take care of the registration, but I have been unable to afford to pay it, and now I won't be able to afford to pay to get my car back, which means that my method of getting to work has been impaired. My car was registered with the office so a simple phone call to me could have saved me hundreds of dollars and them a bad yelp review. On top of that, I had a sinus infection and stayed home sick so when I was able to go to work the car was gone. 

The appliances are cheap and ugly, the paint job is shoddy and covers up half the sockets in the kitchen. My door to my bedroom will not close unless I slam it. The office personnel have either been incredibly unhelpful or have ignored me when I've gone in to pay rent. (To be fair, I was able to have a late fee waived by one office girl, but only because I was able to prove that I had come in 3 days in a row to pay my rent but got poor information each time that led to the increasing late fees) My neighbors play ridiculously loud music at crazy hours. Oh, and I'm still finding blonde hairs everywhere in my room (I have black hair). 

In general, they are a money grubbing company that is quick to enforce anything that is to their financial benefit. There are many things I will tolerate, but taking my car away, my means of transportation to get to my job was the last straw. On a side note, they did the same thing to my roommate who makes even less than I do, so we're both struggling right now. I will not renew my lease and I discourage anyone from living here.",1,0

After I left my previous review, Allen contacted me and offered to let me bring my computer back in even though it was past the warranty. They had it fixed in about a week completely free of charge and were super sweet about it. Thank you guys so much!

They fixed a logic board and screen issue on my MacBook air 2013. While the issue was fixed, they did not put my computer back correctly. The entire edging around my screen is now coming off because they did not glue it back on properly, they stripped the screws and now I cannot get my bottom panel off, and now my camera doesn't work, and it is not a software issue. Most likely is not properly plugged into logic board, but I wouldn't know for sure, because I cannot take the panel off to check. By the time I noticed these things, it had already been 3 or 4 months (this is not my daily computer) so I couldn't bring it back. :( :( :(",0,0

There were a few sitting in the booth near our table. The one employee walked around asking everyone to smell a candle. We had a group of 9 and it took us 20 minutes to get drinks. Then we had to ask 2 other workers for our drinks and one of them was a manager. We ordered 5 appetizers and when they were served we had no plates napkins or silverware. We had to get up to ask for them. My friend ordered red wine and they but it in a chilled almost frozen beer glass because they didn't have any clean wine glasses. I ordered a chicken salad and it barely had 2 ounces of chicken on it. One person at my table didn't even receive their food. We saw it sitting on the table in the back but no one would bring it to the table. We again had to ask for the salad. No one asked if we wanted dessert. The dining area wasn't busy at all.

10,"I was really excited this restaurant opened few months ago in my neighborhood and I finally had a chance to try it. It's very big sports bar/restaurant with many many televisions at every angle. We were seated right away by the hostess and the waitress was really helpful in pointing out their specials. 
We ordered various dishes to try. The food took a long time to arrive and the waitress came by and told us they had only 1 cook in the back. Oh my! They must've had at least a a dozen tables on a Saturday for lunch with 1 cook. Someone must've called in sick.
When our food finally arrived, couple of dishes (personal pizza and appetizer) came out cold. The pizza, which the waitress recommended was a disappointment (very dry, small and cold). The appetizer sampler tasted like something I could've bought at the grocery store and reheated.
The philly steak wasn't much better either. The meat was very dry and the melted cheese over it didn't help at all.
The only thing decent was their spinach salad. It was fresh and the dressing was tasty.

Seriously, iI've had better mexican food in Chicago than most places in Scottsdale/Phoenix! I am happy to report that this place really satisfied an intense mexican craving.  The guacomole is an absolute must order. It seems a little pricey, but it is a very large order (4 hungry girls and 2 baskets of chips didn't finish it) and the chips are bottomless.  Skip the queso, it was too thin and not spicy enough for my taste. I would definitely recommend the chimichangas   Beautiful presentation, crispy, just the right amount of spice, and tender chicken.  While the mexican beer braised enchiladas were good, they didn't live up to their name. I couldn't taste any beer flavor, and the meat could have been a little more tender. My friends reported the shrimp and chicken tacos were both good, but their favorite part was the beans served on the side. Its like a mexican style baked bean...fantastic! It was a quiet night at the restaraunt, which was the lone drawback as I like a place full of people. Although it was nice to be seated immediately and be able to hear your friends without shouting! I will definitely make it a point to return when the weather is nicer to take advantage of their patio, it looked very inviting.

0,"So this is an update to my original review and I have to say maybe after my first experience my expectations were super high.

I sat down as we had reservations and were promptly seated at the window table which was nice.  They handed us 3 different menus which included their drinks, regular menu and brunch menu.  Right away I noticed that my knife was dirty so I asked that I get a new knife.

I ordered the duck tacos and the Korean sandwich.  Considering the prices which are fairly steep we got two duck tacos and they were just average.  Nothing special that warranted $6 a taco that's for sure.

My Korean sandwich came out and I got the pulled pork frites.  I quite enjoyed the pulled pork frites as it was flavourful and had just the right mix of sauce and fries.  The Korean on the other hand was a little bit disappointing.  Again for the price you would hope to get some quality cut of beef but this one was grisly and made eating it very tough.  

After our meal we asked for the dessert menu and instead were presented with the bill.  Again asked for the dessert menu and had the chilli green tea cheesecake which was surprisingly delicious and had just the right combination of green tea and a bit of a kick to it.  Probably this was the highlight of my visit.

Overall, it definitely did not live up to my expectations and for the price I don't think the quality was there but it is definitely worth a try.",0,0

I contacted Mike, texted him a few pics of my falling fence and explained my problem.  He immediately quoted me an estimate that was more than reasonable and less then I thought I'd have to pay. He came the next morning (on Sunday) and did the job quickly and efficiently.  He even taught me a thing or 2 about hanging fences, properly adjusting the height and general maintenance to avoid frequent repairs!   Highly recommend Mike at RJ's Gate Repair.",0,0

Upon arrival, the place looked new! Maybe it was clean, but it was a surprise. Ordered the number one and the number 3 because i was hungry. The meat on both was great! Good flavor. I love how the onions were spicy too.

My cons for this place:
The dressing. It tasted like sour cream, but i wished it tasted like traditional yogurt.
The paper wrapping: my gyro fell apart so easily and i wished they wrapped it completely. They had a small sleeve at one end.

Outstanding burgers, fries, onion rings and atmosphere. They could get more creative on their burger choices, but you can't go wrong with the gold standard and then top it with a fried egg, onion ring, etc. The only complaint I had in my most recent visit was the meat. It was a bit chewy and dense - definitely packed too firm, or the quality of meat wasn't up to par for a $20 burger. Most people probably wouldn't complain. Overall a great burger and value for being in Vegas.

If you want a big treat, try one of the specialty milkshakes (without liquor they're $12). The presentation of the cookies & milk shake was something out of a magazine. Until next time Holsteins!",0,3

There was only five people ahead of me in line. For restaurants like this, that is not very many people at all. The style of eatery can be compared to chipotle. I've been served faster at the eastern location with lines out the door. The people on the line should have spent less time giggling with each other and more time focused on getting people's orders together. 

Their whole food line was a mess. I had dressing spilled all over my dressing cup, grease and whatever else was on their counter all over my salad container, and food spilling from one container into others. One girl was swapping out the dressing, and did not care that it completely spilled into the cheese container. She acted like it did not even happen. My salad tastes okay, my only complaint about the food was my tortilla tastes really old and crunchy. 

The line took so long because there was no one at the stations. When someone finally asked what we wanted, he slid our salads down the line to no one! We stood at the toppings station for a good while before someone came over to help. The manager was completely clueless. He wasn't assertive and didn't tell his staff that they should stay put at their stations to get the line moving. It doesn't take four people to switch out a cheese container.",1,0

3,"I was happy to have visited this location of Primanti's while in town to see the hubby's family in Pittsburgh and Greensburg. We went for a lunch and for it being the day after Christmas, I honestly expected a lot more staff to be available than there were. There were plenty of open seats, but diners had to wait for quite a while before being seated since the staff working the floor were busy delivering orders or placing them and it seemed like cleaning the tables off had the lowest priority. 

I'll be quite honest, we were a large party:18 adults, and our server was visibly stretched a bit thin, but managed to stop by the table twice to make sure our glasses were filled... 

Compared to other locations I have visited, this Primanti just wasn't the same when it came to the food. The hubby and I split an order of the pastrami and had a few bites of the corned beef as well. The corned beef seemed a bit off (not rotten, but just did not taste as flavorful and actually was a bit gamey). The pastrami, thankfully, was superb. It was salty the bread and the slaw together had a nice bite. I was a bit disappointed because I didn't feel there were enough fries crammed in the sandwich and it was a bit drier than I anticipated, as if the sandwich was put together in a hurry and not allowed time to let the juices soak a bit. I was also upset with the flavor of the onion rings. The oil clearly needed to be changed because it had that bitter, sharp, taste that just made the rings taste awful. I think eventually this was done since we also placed an order of the fried zucchini later and those did not have that same taste. The cornmeal batter on the zucchini was quite tasty and I enjoyed the longer, planked shape these were served as rather than circular pieces I have seen elsewhere. We also shared an order of the nachos and I felt the ratio of chips to the ""good stuff"" was very off. A lot of us basically just had sour cream and dry chips. 

Also, where is the Pittsburgh pride? Sure, sure, there are jerseys and sport memorabilia all around, but I am talking about the generic ketchup bottles on the table. I could taste the Heinz inside, but was surprised that the bottles were not Heinz bottles themselves.

I don't think we will return to this location since we are not usually in the area, but I was thankful that there was plenty of free parking right outside the location.",1,1

Either way, this excuse is a real turn-off for me as it shows a lack of social responsibility towards the environment. Even if you are a take out restaurant, why not go the extra mile and charge a deposit for reusable take out containers that customers have to bring back? The majority of your customers probably either work in the area or live around the area, so I don't see why we need to create all this excess garbage to eat a few pieces of sushi. I would go back to try it again, but since everything is served in disposable cups and plates, it makes me so upset and I probably won't go back, sorry.",0,0

1,Came here to check it out due to all the raving reviews and got the soup and wrap combo which was a great deal btw! Ordered the butternut squash soup and chicken wrap and it was alright..  The wrap was a little dry and soup didn't have that sweetness I was expecting. It was alright and perhaps I'll try another soup next time but nothing amazing imo.,0,0
0,"Came here for lunch with a friend on a Thursday.  The food was really good.  I got a turkey sandwich, which had really great flavor.  Unfortunately this place gets only 3 stars from me due to service.  The waitress came to our table and didn't even look at me.  I'm not sure why she did this since most waitresses look at each member of the party and lets them decide who wants to order first.  So my friend ordered and then I ordered, asking specifically for no tomatoes.  I repeated it 2-3 times to make sure she heard me.  Sandwiches came out and mine had huge tomatoes on them so I had to take them out.  It's not that I'm allergic or anything, but I just don't prefer them and I would rather not waste them by having to pick them out of my sandwich.  The waitress did not come back AT ALL to see how we were doing.  My soda ran out about halfway through the meal and she did not come by until at least 3/4 of the way through the meal, asking if I'd like a refill.  So I said yes, and didn't receive the soda until we were paying the bill.  The whole time she was setting tables nearby us as if I had not asked for a refill at all.  I don't mind if it takes a bit longer if the place is crazy packed and busy, but by that time, the lunch rush had been over and there were no additional diners waiting to be seated.  She was just kind of snobby, in my opinion.  Maybe because I looked like I didn't have a lot of money?  I don't know.  I'd like to give this place a shot again; I just hope we get better service next time!",0,0
7,"While the food is great, I can't justify the $420 bill for two people. I have had meals on an equal caliber for half the price ( playground, napa rose etc). service was outstanding.  

This was our second time back and while it was good, I think it'll be our last only because there are so many places in Vegas to try with so little time. 

My black cod was delicious however I enjoy my black cod at Roy's Hawaiian fusion is better and only $40

0,"We stayed here for about two days to celebrare my boyfriends birthday. They upgraded us to a ""nicer"" room. The quotation marks are necessary because the room was mediocre, if that was an upgrade I don't want to know what the original room that we paid for was like. There was a terrible smell of rotten eggs near  the elevators the whole time we were there too. The room was tacky. It needs to be remodeled. The bathroom also needs a major upgrade. The curtains did not go up which was a shame. Ac worked fine which is good because it was around 111 degrees the entire weekend. The location is not bad, close to a Walgreens and clubs if you are into that. The pool was not bad either, I dont think I would stay here again though.",0,0
7,"Sorry but I have to agree with most of the other negative reviews here.  I frequently eat Chinese food at many of the great local places on Spring Mountain Rd.  I expected Mr. Chow to blow away the quality and taste of those places.  However I was extremely disappointed!!  None of the dishes I ordered (Gamblers Duck, Sautéed String Beans, Dungeness Crab Appetizer) would I ever order again and I only really enjoyed one dish - the Shrimp Spring rolls (fried shrimp in a egg roll wrapper) and anyone can make that!
I will give kudos to the excellent attentive service and the beautiful dining room.  But for the prices they charge, you can go out to dinner five times in Chinatown and find some much tastier food.
Dinner for 2 with 1 drink each and a shared dessert was over $200.",2,2

Mystere means ""mystery"" in French.

Let me tell you something. Either they did a good job on keeping the mystery of why there was a freakin snail throughout the whole production or I just don't get it.

Whatever.

I love watching Cirque du Soliel shows simply because it makes you FEEL -- whether it be amazement, joy, bliss, wonder.  Everyone's opinions will be different but it evokes a reaction out of you. 

Mystere isn't as mind-blowing as Ka, as artistic as ""O"" or as musically wonderful as LOVE by the Beatles.  But there were lighthearted moments, like when the baby called one of the audiences ""papa"" (and proceeded to call him as papa the WHOLE show!) There were laugh out loud moments -- seriously, who is that obscene man throwing popcorn and spilling bubbly on the audience?!

And there were the classic moments that only a cirque show can provide: the flying trapeze act, the man with the steel cube, the two gymnasts who did a difficult balancing act and challenging poses with each other.

In the end, I stopped trying to figure out what the snail meant and took Mystere just for what it is: a good show.

* check Mirage's website for discounts before buying your tickets. Especially during the summer season where they slash the prices about 40%. Check with your hotel for discounts as well; staying at the Trump gave us a buy 1 get 1 free pass to Mystere*",16,18

2,"I've been to Paper St. on two occasions now and admittedly I am less enthused about the experience the second time around. On my first foray into Paper St. I tried the elotes which is corn served with chipotle feta cheese and poblano mayo. Don't let the peppers fool you, it is not a spicy dish but it is creamy and delicious. I followed that up with the ramen burger which was delicious (very buttery) but if not eaten fast enough the noodles will come apart.

I popped back in yesterday to have more elotes, and decided to try their soup of the day which was a Manhattan chowder. The chowder was good, and it was served in a creamy tomato broth as opposed to the usual white broth you get with New England chowder. As delicious as it was, the broth was runny and could hardly be called a chowder. It was a good soup, but definitely not chowder. I then moved on to the yakisoba and was so underwhelmed with the entire dish. The noodles were unctuous as ramen noodles should be, but the whole flavor profile was bland. A little acid to brighten up the dish would not have hurt or maybe some ginger to brigthen up, I don't know. All I can say is that was not a dish I would come back and have again.

The crowd the second time around was the corporate after work crowd, and they had the Jays game on which I am always up for watching. The service was somewhat friendly, but not welcoming. Overall a decen eatery that I would again come back to, if only to order the elotes and have a beer.",0,0

THE FOOD- The Mexican street corn is probably my favourite thing on the menu but like all the food at LC is overpriced for what you get. The tortilla chips in the chips and dip are fresh and well-seasoned, very yummy! I've tried most of the tacos and they're all good (although nothing really stands out) but once again they're overpriced for what they are.

We googled nearby sushi places and this came up. We placed an order for pick up and saw decent reviews. We ordered salmon roll, tuna roll, spicy dynamite, and dynamite.

I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this has been the worst sushi I have ever had in my life. I have been to plenty of sushi restaurants from the high end like Nobu to any regular round about town sushi joints. This is also the only sushi place I have been to that the ginger and the wasabi came in their own packages. Every aspect of it was horrendous. The rice was plastic mush, the seafood was questionably fresh. Everything was bad and I feel like an idiot for actually not throwing it out right away.

They also have a great rewards program you use with your phone number. You earn stars for each entree and for every 7 stars you earn you get $10 off your bill.

I believe I came in on a soft opening and they had a simple menu which I appreciated.

I had the pho king pho bo and bang bang sliders.
The pho was interesting in a good way.It had a different flavor than the norm viet pho. I believe it's advertised as having a Thai twist. The noodles were really good and so we're the meatballs. The one thing I did not enjoy was the meat in it. It was pretty chewy.

Bang bang sliders were good! The value was also great -3 pretty big sliders for $8. The meat was really tender and I like the buns.

We had a pretty good seat once we got placed, and our waitress was extremely friendly. It did take a long time though just to be able to get our drinks, salads, and the bread however.

5,"I've been dyeing my hair since I was 12 years old thanks to genes that blessed me with prematurely greying hair. For most of my life, I've dyed it myself. Even when I went to salons, stylists complemented me on my color, so I figure I've done a decent job.

Lately I've been having my roots professionally done because between the rock hard water and years of hair dye, I don't want to fry my hair. 

After watching zillions of hours of Guy Tang on Youtube, I knew I wanted to get bayalage highlights and a root touch up before my wedding.

I decided to check trusty Yelp and went with The Parlor after scrolling through lots of their wonderful looking photos. 

When I came in, it was weird because the girl at the front desk didn't say anything. The owner was dealing with another customer so I just waited until he was done to check in.

Bryce was my stylist and I showed him a photo from their Yelp page of what I wanted my hair to look like. He did a root touch up and balayage. 2.5 hours and $171 later (including tip and 15% 1st time check-in discount) I was done.

A few days later I couldn't help but notice I was not feeling my look. I'm paper white, with pink undertones in my skin, and naturally dark hair. Unfortunately my hair was colored with warm tones and too blonde for my tastes. 

I was legitimately freaking out because it was my wedding that week. I texted  pictures of my hair to all of the ladies in my family and the consensus was the color wasn't flattering on me. 

Luckily I emailed the owner and he offered to have my hair fixed for free. He set the appointment and when I came in, I guess the system set my appointment for a day I already said I'd be out of the state.  Because of the appointment mix up, Bryce was busy, so colorist Emanuel fixed my hair. He put cool tones throughout and it came out perfect. 

I'm just glad it got fixed in time.",1,2

First momo's they were not fresh and seems to be reheated in the oven. Followed with noodles, again reheated and I have never have to chew chicken that much that my jaw hurts. Lamb curry was top of line, I practically felt like eating salt mine and all the lamb pieces were merely bones, it was like mystery box where I have to find the meat.

- Within a new parking complex on Consumers Rd / Yorkland
- They have a pretty big sign, so you can't miss it
- Parking is available in the parking complex, P1 and P2 are available for visitors
- Inside is pretty big that can accommodate large groups. Modern furniture and bright lightning. Also like their windows bringing the natural light during the day

Food
- It has a mix of Japanese, Chinese/Korean cuisine. Mostly is based on Japanese style, so you have a your choices of Ramen, Sushi, Katsu, etc.
- Their sushi/sashimi is good, quality is not too top-notch, but alright as a quick meal
- Also tried their unagi (eel) rice. The eel was done right, consistent to other places that offers with complimenting sauce that mixes well eating it with the rice

10,"If you're a fan of Rao's at Caesars or the original in Harlem in NYC, then you know the Pellegrino family and their cooking.  

Recently, Carla, the executive chef of Rao's and her husband, Frank, Jr., divorced...she got 10 family recipes in the settlement and has installed her sister who has been by her side at the stoves for the past 10 years along with brother in law, Walter, to run the front of house.

Why the name?  Bratalian combines her Brazilian roots (she was born in Rio), with her Italian heritage...but make no mistake, there is nothing Brazilian on the menu.

Carla will be opening a new restaurant at the newly renovated Tropicana shortly, she reported - and given its Miami Beach theme by the pool, I'm guessing that's where the Rio flare may begin to show.

Most important to know is that while they're newly opened, their liquor license isn't in place until mid April - so it's BYOB, and diners can benefit from no corkage fee for their first month.  

One visit isn't enough for a review - but since it wasn't listed yet,  I wanted to get the word out.  

The location is where the former Chef's Palate used to be - a nice sized 100+ seat spot on southern Eastern, near Horizon Ridge, as you head to Anthem and Seven Hills.  With the pleasant weather, you can dine on their small but rare patio.

They're open for lunch and dinner.  Dishes are classic neopolitan fare - antipasti, primi, secondi and desserts.  

We wish them great luck and are thrilled she chose to not only stay in town but to bring her culinary talents to our local neighborhood...

I've been in the area for the past 2 years, and always curious about the hype of this restaurant. Always long lines in the morning for this place, no weather can turn away some hungry people. Since I had a day off today, my girlfriend and I decided to venture out. By 10:30 a line had already formed but the hostess said it would be quick for 2 people. It end up being about a 15 minute wait, not bad compared to other places I've been to. However, behind us the monstrous line began to form. It's a really cozy, old school looking place. The menu is pretty straight forward, Benny's and Waffles or regular breakfast. I went with the Peameal Benny and my girlfriend went with the Waffle Benny or something like that. My Benny was pretty good. I had asked for light hollandaise and the server said they usually do it light - well it wasn't lol. I had to scoop some off. The egg was done perfectly and runny - just the way I like it. My friend really loved her waffle too. We both enjoyed the rosti and the apple slaw.

Why did I contemplate about just half a start? Well for starters, I felt the brunch was lacking in the portion size. They gave a good amount of peameal on the english muffins, but there wasn't enough rosti and slaw that made me full. My friend also commented the same, that she felt ""hungry"" after we ate lol. We don't want to be in a food coma, but we still want to feel satisfied and full afterwards. Also the wait is long. I felt bad for the people at the end of the line.

3,"It's nice to go to a restaurant where the staff seems anxious to please and appears to really care if you are enjoying your meal.  A+ for that, Grande Stand.  But unfortunately that's all that you do really well.  The ""star"" hamburger is just not tasty.  Yes, the beef has the consistency of fresh ground, but did you run out of salt and pepper?  The bun is weak, and the other fixings average.  Even with the mountain of super hot fries, $13 is not a great value (same price for a Sonora dog - wow!).   

Between 6 and 6:30 pm on an in-season Thursday, Grande Stand was devoid of other customers.  I think if they are to stay open, they must decide what they want to be: a quick stop for a meal before the movies (then lower your prices) or a premium burger place (then increase your offerings and get a much better bun and invest in some spices).

3,"This was our first time visiting. Since they have been open nearly a year we thought they would have things perfected. We were wrong unfortunately. 

Starting with the positives: we really liked the funky interior and music as well as the staff we encountered. The place is much larger than we thought and wasn't very crowded. 

As for the food, we were left underwhelmed. As an appetizer, I ordered a spinach salad minus the cheese and it was good. My wife ordered the mushroom soup, which she said tasted great but was warm not hot. She also ordered the pretzels to share with our kids and they weren't anything special. 

For the main dish she got the Herb veggie burger and tried to sub a tossed salad instead of the potatoes. No dice but they did sub for steamed broccoli. Cold, wet and limp broccoli. Her burger was not good and she ate less than half of it. I should note, she was really hungry when we arrived so she really didn't like it. 

I ordered a vegan veg out and while it was tasty wasn't anything I would come back for. They also charge $3 more for vegan cheese which isn't stated anywhere I read on the menu. 

For the price, I doubt we will be back.",0,2
17,"I take three very inexpensive generic drugs that I could easily afford to pay for out of pocket. I also take two expensive 'inhaler' breathing medications that are not covered by SilverScript. The costs that were quoted to me by SilverScript for those 2 drugs would bury me financially!  Because Medicare requires me to have Part D (drug) insurance (or pay future penalties), I pay SilverScript approx. $30 every month. For the first 9 months of this year, SilverScript has paid a total of $33.66 and I have paid $192.48 for my INEXPENSIVE generic drugs! My drug store even texted me and said, 'this one particular drug I was getting is CHEAPER (roughly $3) if you don't run it through your insurance company. And if you are wondering about my two expensive inhalers?  All I can say is thank God for CANADA!! I get twice the amount for approx. 1/2 the cost! So I only have to order the drugs roughly every 3 1/2 months. Oh, the shipping cost?  $9.00 #@%* dollars!  Woohoo!   I called Medicare a couple of weeks ago to complain about their 'recommendation' of SilverScript and told them exactly what I have written here.  Since I really have to hold on to the Part D insurance or get penalized in the future, he recommended that I go with the cheapest insurance I can find, which will be about $19 per month.  Oh, and SilverScript? Their cost for me went up to $35 per month beginning January 2019.  GOOD RIDDANCE!",0,0
0,"I had heard about this place through my cousin and I can say I enjoyed the food there. KGB makes some good burgers any way you like em. I went ahead and customized my fixings in it. They have a good variety of stuff including a fried egg and jalapenos. The onion rings were very tasty and I thoroughly enjoyed the burger. 

I also tried their mac n cheese sticks which is basically macaroni and cheese fried into a cheese stick shape. Very tasty. The most unusual food I had there was the Captain Crunch milkshake. Yes like the cereal. Its basically captain crunch blended into a malt vanilla shake. It actually tastes good, much like the cereal in milk.

2,"We always visit Pampas for dinner when we are in Vegas. We do typically purchase the Travelzoo or Groupon deal - 2 Rodizio dinners with a pitcher of sangria for $55 - way cheaper than when you go there to eat - and probably better than the coupons you can get on the strip too.

We took our friend this year, who does not eat red meat and overall it was a decent experience. Only 4 stars though because 1) we were never offered all the meats - maybe only 5 or 6 types rather than the 10+ they promise - and we saw all the meats, they just intentionally ignored our table even though we had the green side up and 2) service was so poor and slow. We were NEVER checked on by our waiter, we actually had to get up and SEARCH for him to get our bill.

17,"The Fun Dungeon is exactly as it sounds -- it's a super fun arcade in the ""dungeon"" at the Excalibur! I live in Las Vegas and avoid the Strip but once in a while I like to go down and hit all the casino arcades (Circus Circus is the granddaddy of all arcades in town but the Fun Dungeon comes a close second). 

Here you'll find all the standard video games (Terminator, Ms. Pac Man, Guitar Hero, Star Wars, race car driving games, skeeball, and lots of old and new favorites). No matter what tickles your fancy, you'll find something you like to play. 

The absolutely greatest feature of the Fun Dungeon is the addition of classic carnival games! I love love love LOVE the games where you roll a ball into a hole and your ""horse"" or ""dragon"" or ""viking ship"" moves. The first one across the finish line wins a prize. Pro tip: try to get as many players to join in for $2 each and you get to play for the best and biggest prize possible! I'm pretty good at these games so I usually win a super cool prize (and then at the end of the night I'll give it to a kid in the arcade who is empty handed). 

Minus a star because all of the claw games cost at least $1.00 per play. That's just way too expensive for me. Add a star because there is a Dairy Queen right in the middle of the arcade.

If you like to collect tickets for prizes, there are swell ticket counting machines that take the math out of the equation. Just feed your tickets into the machines and you'll get a receipt that lists the total number of tickets you earned. Save them up or take them over to the counter and redeem for worthless trinkets (uh, I mean SWEET PRIZES)!

Don't worry if you don't have little ones in tow, my husband and I go here all the time and nobody ever bats an eye. A really fun diversion if you are sick of gambling on the Strip.",11,11
2,"It's been exactly one year since I last reviewed this place. Thankfully, a lot of the issues I brought up last year have been addressed. 

Lockers: They changed the locker system and got rid of the frustrating keypad locks. They were a nuisance for two reasons: 1) they consistently broke, died or malfunctioned; and 2) it made it very hard to remember which locker was yours. You now have to bring your own lock, which helps to overcome the second point somewhat since not all the locks are identical. For some reason it is much, much easier to find an empty locker these days. I don't know if people just stopped using lockers or are too lazy/cheap to buy a $5 lock (they even sell them at the juice bar), but I never have to hunt for a locker anymore even during peak hours.

Towels: The towel stations are still useless and should probably just be removed. There are never towels in them. All the towels are usually at the front, and availability has improved. There are some occasions when they are in the process of washing a new batch, but it's not problematic. They've also done away with the ""You can only get towels when you check in"" rule. 

Overall I've seen a pretty drastic improvement in the gym over the last year. There's a different vibe from what I can tell. The memberships seem to have leveled off; I've even encountered several nights where the basketball court was empty at 8 pm. I hope the improvements are maintained.",0,0

3,"Again, I came to YELP to hear some unbiased feedback on FitFreshCuisine and was willing to accept any reviews under Hybrid Fitness as this is a co-op type business. Alas, nothing. Kudos on working together and bringing everything in 1 place. 

I will return after completing my month with FitFreshCuisine but to date the customer service is lacking on all levels (e.g. in person, via telephone, email, Facebook). Yep! I started with an email - NO RESPONSE. Decided to ""Like"" the company so I could follow along and learn more then after commenting on the wall - no response.

The silence made me realize I had never heard back from anyone and the website doesn't tell me what to expect for meals (in the meal planning service) so I'll just go in person. They advertise 2 locations but the PARK St. location is ""only a restaurant"" according to the guy behind the counter & ""it's really two separate places"". So I called before driving over to make an appointment to be seen in Fitchburg by the Dietitian. HYBRID answered & I went in to sign up for the DAILY meal plan for 1month. Will update on December 1st.  FYI: I don't know if the young girl was a dietitian and I doubt it based on her commentary because she stated she didn't know to expect me (although I made an appt) and ""they just threw this on me.""

She was sweet enough and the info was simple enough but I'm paying good money to lose weight and willing to trust someone in their business to deliver. To that end, things haven't went the way I envisioned, nor how the website provides. I'm hoping at some point the owner or a Dietitian will check in with me to make sure I hit the goals I want. This will determine my willingness to sign up for longer terms & become loyal. 

THE PROCESS: 
1) fill out forms on allergies & your food preferences
2) Pick up meals on M/W/F. 
3) I'm on the Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner - 5days a week for 1 month. I learned weekends are not included. I thought they were but no biggie. 
4) meals are usually 300-400 and they can adjust to hit your numbers (I'm leaving 1800 daily to move down to 1600 and they can meet my 1400 requirement)
5) Fill out comment forms when you finish your meals so they will adjust food options to help meet your taste bud requirements. DISCLAIMER: I haven't done it yet but repeating what I was told at sign-up. 
6) There's no dedicated or sample menu from previous weeks. 
7) Pay in full and start when you want. 
8) You must email in advance if you plan on starting or stopping. And pay in advance. Simple and fair enough requests.",0,2

4,"NASTY! 

I have lived in Phoenix now for 7 years and have been searching and searching for an up to standard Chinese food restaurant (specifically Sesame Chicken)... and thought I would give this place a try after reading the reviews. 

Another disappointment. The lunch menu is tiny, they didn't even know what Sesame chicken was and my food came out in literally 1 minute which makes me think they have a vat of it sitting in the kitchen pre-made. My  mom ordered the sweet & sour prawns and we were both surprised she could even take a bite to try it... just looked plain nasty. 

The soup was disgusting and offered no choice besides the ""soup of the day"" nasty vegetable eggdrop and I have never before see some of the things that were cooked inside the eggroll. Scary. 

Guessing I will just give up on my search and have to fly into NYC or California for a plate, thank god I am a flight attendant and can do so! 

Such a disappointment Phoenix Chinese food restaurants are, how is there not ONE good go-to? You Phoenicians have no standards when writing these reviews, I will never yelp another Chinese place and take the locals words for it's rating.

They always remember their regular customers by name. It seems like they really appreciate your business and want to make you happy.

1,"I had the worst experience I have ever had at a Chipotle. I am a regular here too. I arrived at 8:05 and they ran out of chicken and steak. They said 5-10 minutes. So I filled out a form with my order, paid and sat down. After 10 minutes the chicken was still not ready. I proceeded to wait because I already paid for my food. After 25 minutes I saw they started serving food to everyone that had just walked in. I stood up went to the cashier and said I had been waiting and others are being served before me. The cashier told me to wait that she will get to my order. Sure enough the young woman gave me the nastiest look for speaking up. She put the rice and beans in my bowl and then went back to completing the people behind me their orders. At that point I said again come on I have been waiting. The woman proceeded to give me a mean look, the cashier was rude to me. Once my bowl was complete it was 8:40. They had forgotten my side tortilla. I said something the woman threw it in foil and bunched it together. After seeing her reaction towards me like that I asked for their manager. The manager came out and was very apologetic. However, he told me he thought the other manager was going to fire the young woman. The fact that your saying that to customers shows your poor management. You are aware of a problem employee and are not doing anything about it. I finally left at 8:45. They refunded me my meal, but I will never come back to that Chipotle. I read other reviews and it's a common problem. Seems like there needs to be new management and employees.

2,"My friend Agnes (originally from Singapore) who lives in Columbus, visited me in Cleveland in mid-June 2019. We stopped by Pho Tang Cafe on a Friday night for dinner on a Saturday night. She wanted to eat some Vietnamese Pho. 

FOOD -- I ordered the Shrimp fried rice ($13) and my friend ordered a Pork Pho I think. The shrimp fried rice was edible and good but I've had better. With so many onions on my plate, I couldn't enjoy my dinner at all. I don't like or eat onions. My friend liked her Pho (soup). 

SERVICE -- The service was attentive and standard. The waitress brought out water and soup as a starter. The only issue was that I wish I was told that there were onions in my dish. Perhaps the servers can explain the menu items better. I didn't read about onions on the menu. Perhaps, I should just always just have the mindset that there will be onions always in their food, no matter what.

LOCATION -- It was hard for me to find the place because the restaurant is inside a work building and the sign outside on the street wasn't too clear. The building was quiet when I arrived on Saturday evening so it felt as if nobody was around. There is a barbershop in the main floor as you enter the building so those workers directed me to the restaurant. Once you enter the building, pass the barbershop on the left and then walk down the hall until you find the restaurant. 

I think this is an average restaurant in downtown Cleveland.

They also offer up other small side dishes that are worth trying out if you're into tofu and what not. I personally don't like tofu, but I did try the stinky tofu, a Chinese favourite apparently. You can smell them in the parking lot.. It really is quite stinky, but tastes pretty nice actually. I still do not like tofu so I just come for some really delicious noodles.

The noodles themselves are chewy and thicker since they make them homemade. I really appreciate a place that makes their own noodles and broth, rather than some flavour pack and pre-packaged ramen noodles or something. :) 

I wouldn't say that it's the best noodles out there or that the flavours are all that special, but it hits the spot and at a great price too! Parking is hell though because it is FMP, so arrive early, and be patient. People are always leaving, so it's just a matter of hunting down a lane. =P",0,0

4,"This is my first time I brought my car in to this shop.  In fairness I bought my tires at this place at a great price.  It was also difficult to find my tires in general.  This is where the positives end.  The service took about 1.5 to 2 hours longer than promised.  They didn't provide a printout for the alignment they did, which is always provided by other shops.   Two weeks after I purchased and had the tires installed, I felt a vibration in the steering wheel and waited a few weeks before I brought the car for an inspection.  The diagnosis was that all the weights on the wheels (for balancing purposes) have come off.  In my 28 years of driving I have never experienced or heard about this happening.  Not sure how this could happen.  In addition, since I left the car before they opened that day, I was expecting a call that never came.  Good thing I called because they were about to do service that I didn't request and not do what I wanted done in the first place. Lastly, they never called to let me know that the car was ready for pickup until I called later in the day.  Overall, between the two times I've been at this shop, I have nothing good to say.  While I don't recommend this shop, it still is worth checking their website for good deals on tires.  I would just have the tires installed somewhere else.  Thanks.",1,0

Compared to the world at large, well, you're better off eating just about anywhere else. 

I was recently faced with a six hour layover in Vegas, courtesy of my friends at Spirit Airlines, who are unable to get their $hit together. I figured I'd make the best of it and get drunk at the airport, and have a last go at Mexican food before heading back to Boston.

This is the kind of airport gouging that I sometimes find infuriating... no chips and salsa at the table, $10 cocktails, no side salads, etc. Other times I grit my teeth and say nothing, but with such a long layover and such terrible options overall, well, I really just wanted to get out of Vegas.

I ordered a double vodka soda ($15), a full-sized Caesar salad ($9, no side salads as an option here) and a carne asada burrito ($12 I think, maybe $15).  The drink was strong but nothing was especially good about the meal. 

Side note here: Logan Airport, in Boston, has a law against price gouging at the airport. Just because you're a captive behind TSA security lines doesn't mean you should have to spend $60 on lunch.

As I was eating the burrito, I kept thinking that something in the seasoning was really familiar. It took a long time for me to recognize it, but that flavor was Taco Bell, which I haven't eaten in about twenty years. So yeah, this isn't great Mexican fare. 

Another double vodka soda later, and a few bucks lighter, I was ready to take a nap in the long walkway between terminals. If there are any entrepreneurs looking for an opportunity to open a restaurant in Vegas that serves something other than Taco Bell beef or deep fried everything, I recommend scouting locations in this busy airport! It might be expensive to rent here, but if what you serve is even halfway decent, you'll make a killing.",1,0
0,"Had the Spinach,  Cucumber,  and Goat Cheese burger and Sweet Potato Fries and ... wow! One of the best burgers I've had had in a long time. Food was hot and toppings were fresh and crisp.
Topped off with a great strawberry shake - they even left the mixing cup for what didn't fit in the glass. Nice touch.

Comatose now but definitely worth it. Will definitely be back.",0,0

0,"I made an appointment over the phone to have a trailer hitch installed that would accomodate my bike rack. I measured my bike rack and found it to be 2"". The customer service person (apparently from a call center) on the phone said that this particular hitch needed to be ordered and that she would do that.  Once I got to the store for my appointment, I made sure to show the owner (working at the counter) the picture of my bike rack to include me holding a tape measure that showed the exact size of my bike rack's post.  As I was waiting for my install to be completed, the service tech asked for me to come look at my car so that he could explain something to me.  As he was explaining that he may have to cut away some of the underbody plastic to accommodate my hitch I noticed that he installed the wrong size hitch.  How does this happen when I have tried to ensure the proper size?! Somebody (or two) is not listening. I asked them to remove the hitch and they said they would have to order the one I needed because they didn't have it in stock.  That was my experience.  I am now looking for a new installer.  Good customer service is not that difficult to achieve if you listen to your customers and work with them to make sure the proper equipment is being installed.",0,0

8,"Finally here to see if I should believe the hype. Drinks and snacks oh my! We ordered the salt and pepper karage with Tapatio hot sauce which was delicious and served with ranch dressing for dipping 4/5. Mac and Cheeto is a new dish, I mean how can you go wrong with cheesy Mac n cheese and then top it off with crunched flaming hot Cheetos 4/5. We also ordered the elote, corn topped with cheese and optional flaming hot Cheetos on top, divine to the last kernel 5/5.

They have a flavored water jug to the left of the cash register. Free WIFI available.

Tip: There is a winged selfie spot in the lobby, pose and snap away!

Tip2: Get the gift cards while you can, you receive a 20% discount for a limited time!

**********Update: Second visit, had to get the elote again and tried it without the Cheetos this time, still 5/5! We ordered the honey barbecue karage with ranch dressing 4/5, and lastly the Mac and Cheeto again. Three dishes is plenty for 2-3 people. Always best fresh, so be aware if you try to take to go.

Enjoy the mouthwatering pics!",6,8

0,"I went there on a Sunday afternoon and was promply greeted at the door by a friendly server. Looking around, I noticed the place wasn't very crowded but that is to be expected on Sunday lunchtime. No sooner than I sat down, the server came over and took my drink order. I just ordered a diet soda which was about 20oz. and well carbonated! 

The decor was very interesting - the wall were wood panel with various mounted fish and televisions but the ceiling was just a commercial tile. It seemed like a really strange combination. I guess that's why I noticed it!

For lunch I ordered the Thai calamari and the grouper sandwich, which was on special. The appetizer came in short order and was pretty good. The Thai sauce gave it a kick and overpowered the heavy breading - which was a good thing! Soon after finishing the appetizer, the grouper sandwich showed up. It was grilled and a little fishy smelling. Obviously it was frozen for quite some time because the color varied from bright white to pale transparent cream, but it was still edible. I wouldn't order it again. 

All in all, I would probably go back but it would have to be later in the evening so I could down a few drinks in an attempt to make the average food taste better!",0,0
0,"I'm not sure why it says PALAZZA, but I ate at the Hong Kong Café.

Their service was superb...to an extent.  It was like they knew when to put more water into our glasses w/out us having to flag them down.  They swoop up the empty plates at the right time and move the other plates (like the appetizers) to the center of the table.  It's like they adjust everything just perfect and fill everything perfectly.  As if they read your mind.  They even brought out the check at the right moment.  You know where it's not too soon while you still have food at the table and its not to long from the time you finished your meal.  What was too good to be true was they tried to pick up the bill fold and we weren't ready just yet for it to be picked up.  But it's cool.  Service wise, it was excellent.

Food, I ordered the oven roasted duck with rice.  Excellent.  Can I compare it to the usual spot that I order duck from?  No.  All I can say is that each place has a unique taste/flavor that I cannot compare each to.  The duck here was very flavorful and moist and tender.  

We ordered chicken wings for appetizers, two orders.  For some reason one of the orders was spicier than the other.  One plate my brother and sister took from, when they took a bite they  immediately said, ""oh my g', this is spicy.""  I happen to take from the other plate and for a minute I'm looking at them like, ""What are you talking about?  This isn't spicy.""  So yes, for whatever reason, one set of chicken wings was way spicier than the other.

For dessert we tried their egg tart.  The crust was excellent, IF it had a meat like product in it.  The egg/custard part wasn't all that great.  It wasn't sweet at all.  So if I had to give stars out of five, five being awesome, it would get a one.  

So with all that being said, Happy EATINGS! @~~}~~~~",0,0

I placed my order online today at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I requested my order to be ready at 6:30. I arrived at the location at 6:28. When they looked up my order, they hadn't even started it. They told me it was going to be an additional 25 minutes. I told them that I had requested to have the pizza ready at 6:30. Their excuse ""oh we got busy and our online orders don't take precedence ""

So then I asked for a refund, and it took them almost 10 minutes to figure out how to refund my money.

The first ingredient was water followed by water.

2,"I love to stay at B&Bs!  Sadly, I did not love this one...  Our family stayed at the Parador Inn for our nephew's wedding celebration which was held on site.  The lodgings were kitschy but quaint and the fireplace in the room was really lovely during the September cold snap!  The notice in the room asked for dietary restrictions so I brought mine up with Dee and she was more than happy to accommodate.  Ed wasn't so happy with our low carb or vegetarian diets but he did fix egg whites for the low carb people!  He became prickly when the mother of the groom and I had to shift family members in rooms to accommodate octogenarian grandparents who found they could not climb a couple of steep sets of stairs to their assigned room.  We noticed that he did work tirelessly to help the caterer with the wedding but felt we were quite an inconvenience for him during this time.  I believe this would be a nice place to stay so long as Ed doesn't become frazzled.  We loved the puppies, they just need to be kept off the lawn prior to outdoor functions to lower the chance of accidents to zero for the next wedding party...",1,1

0,"So, I'll start by saying the only reason I'm giving it a 3 & not a 1 is because our waitress was a sweetheart. Went to this location on 5/27/19, around 5:30-6:00 PM. Jump right into it; My moms fork & the napkin it was wrapped in was dirty, as in had food on the inside of the napkin & stuck to the prongs of the fork. Next thing; I found a BUG in my beer, yes a BUG! When we told our waitress about both incidents, she was very apologetic & assured us the manager was on his way to speak with us. After we had already been waiting for quite some time, the waitress came back over & said she was sorry & the manager would be right over. Some more time went by (we're also running late to our movie because of this manager) we get the waitress & she's apologizing again, gives us the check & shows us the manager took a whomping $3 off the bill. As we all sit & talk about how ridiculous this is, we also noticed the manager was just standing behind the bar this entire time, drinking a soda & peering over at us. He clearly was NOT busy, just apparently terrible at his job. Now, our machine on the table isn't working & wont let us use our card to pay. I walk up to the bar & tell our waitress, who apologizes AGAIN, rings up our bill, but not before she discounts it by removing an appetizer for us. Point is, Applebee's, get yourself a new manager because this guy made you guys look terrible. We will never come back to this location again. I'd rather drive to the other side of town for an Applebee's than go get treated like this!",0,0
0,"Wow. The first and only word out of the Greeter's mouth was, ""four?"" Not another word. Our waiter Dillon was excellent. He portrayed the same class that the ambiance was attempting. The range of food options was very limited. Our waiter tried to offer us some variety. However the chef said he had ""limited ingredients"". The pizzas were average in taste and severely lacking in ingredients.  It was no wonder the restaurant was half full at 7 o'clock on Saturday. A lot of wasted potential.",0,0
0,Okay now Bellridge Apartments are trying to collect monies from my son for rent with numerous late fees. This place never compassionated him for the upstairs apartment that flooded and caused him to move out for a month until the carpet was torn out in fact the repair men just dry walled over the wet moldy drywall. They are in the business to sue every renter and ruin your credit so you can not rent any where else. The health conditions he has suffered living in the mild infested place. Stay away from this place it should be torn down  numerous drug addicts do your own research so many murders and drug related crimes . No one should have to live in this slum bed bug infested apartment. The city needs to deem this a slum and tear down. The area is trying to change with new condos and businesses but the apartment complex needs to torn down.,0,0

1,"Ginbu for us, has become the fallback for delivery.  The sushi is decent and at times surprisingly really good.  The delivery is prompt, and the people are nice.  It's fits our needs great.  Other than sushi, we have only ever ordered the Pad Thai and house ginger salad, my advice is skip those two.  However, the Hot and Sour  soup and sea weed salad were  much better.  Like I said before, the sushi is always decent, and at times really good.  If your looking for delivery that isn't pizza, Id try Ginbu.  for what it's worth even know I only gave it a three star, we seem to order from here 2-3 times a month so we do really like it.",0,0
2,"I'm not typically review writer, but the abysmal service I have received through One Guard must be shared.  My wife and I purchased what we thought was a great home warranty from a great provider.  We had a refrigerator repair request that we put in for on 4/16/14.  It wasn't completely repaired until 8/6/14.  After sending two inept repairmen to my home I paid another trade service fee just to get a different company to come to my home.  We literally soaked up water from underneath our refrigerator for four months waiting on One Guard and their contracted partners to provide service. 

     In July we placed a service call for our pool piping which I observed looked deformed in some places.  They had a gentleman come out two different times (after paying two different trade service fees) and render two different opinions on why the swelling of the pipes had occurred. He initially said that the water feature pump valve was left open with no water flow causing the pipes to swell.  The next time he came out he stated that the pipes had frozen due to ice.  That's interesting because we purchased the home in March and live in Dallas, TX.  The pipes didn't freeze in March.  One Guard assured me they would resolve my matter and couldn't believe it took four months to resolve the issue with the refrigerator.  Of course today I received an email (not a call as promised) stating that a second opinion had been received and the pipes had swollen because the water pump had not been maintained with proper water level.  Keep in mind that my wife and I use a pool service to clean our pool and have never altered the pump timers as they are computerized and on timers.  We've literally never touched the pool pump equipment.  We know nothing about it.  I have receipts where we have paid a service since the week we moved in.

     Needless to say it is evident that the One Guard plan covering ""Pre-Exsisting"" conditions isn't worth the paper it's printed on.  This company provides lack luster customer service and even poorer repair work.  I still believe warranties can be a good value, but go elsewhere if you don't want to be taken for a ride.",0,0
